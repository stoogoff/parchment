bodyClass: astronaut

## Start

The Crew are hanging around in **Holt** when they get a call from **Izon**, an enemy in need. She has a friend, **Bane**, who is sick and needs someone to cure him. **Izon** is in **Rinn** and can't possibly get to **Sonhandra** in time. Even though **Izon** and the Crew aren't friends, she's prepared to pay **6 CRED** to help her friend out.

## The Job

**Bane** runs the **Silverhold** bar and gambling den in **Sheen**, a small town in the **Twilight Zone** of **Sonhandra**. When the Crew arrive they find many of the townsfolk are sick. Some have angry red rashes on exposed skin, while others have developed chitinous patches with tendrils sprouting from them. The people of **Sheen** are being changed.

**Bane** is sick in bed in his room above the **Silverhold**. He's never heard of **Izon** but received a package containing an *Ur-Artefact* a couple of weeks ago. The artefact---a gold disc the size of a plate with blue stone hovering, disconnected from the disc, in its centre---is pulsing with *Way* energy.

## Complications

The Crew gets sick from the *Ur-Artefact*.

A Templar of the **Church of Stellar Flame** arrives at *Sheen* to cleanse the townsfolk of their sickness.

An Acolyte of **The Agony** arrives at *Sheen* to claim the townsfolk as their own.

## Notes

This job is aimed at **Stitch** characters.

Replace **Izon**, and **Bane** with friends and enemies of your player-characters to make the job more relevant to them.
