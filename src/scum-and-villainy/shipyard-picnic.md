title: Shipyard Picnic
---

A racer wants to boost her winning chances and a prototype engine---and the Crew---can help her do that.

## Start

The Crew is cooling its heels after their last job. They're taking it easy at the **Solar Horizon**, a bar in a junker station on the edge of the **Shipyards** in the **Iota** system.

## The Job

**Telum** is intending to race in the upcoming **Echo Wave Riders** big race in **Brightwind** in **Brek**. She has the entrance fee covered but needs to upgrade her ship first. Recently, **Esperon Astronauticals**, an advanced *Ur-Tech* engineering company, has been test-flying a new spaceship around the **Shipyards**. The ship has a prototype **Afterburner** attached to the engine---the fastest **Telum** has ever seen.

**Telum** wants the prototype **Afterburners** from the ship and is willing to pay **6 CRED** for it. She knows the prototype ship was taken back to the **Esperon** development facilities on **Indri**.

## Complications

**Static**, a racer and member of the **Echo Wave Riders**, also wants the **Afterburners** from the prototype. He has employed **Ven**, a *Saurian* thief, gunslinger and scoundrel, to raid the **Esperon** facility. **Ven** will arrive just in time to make things difficult for the Crew.

While **Esperon Astronauticals** is an independent company, the prototype is being developed to fit into a new range of **Hegemony** patrol ships. This work is being funded by **House Malklaith** and the engine parts have their crest stamped on them.
