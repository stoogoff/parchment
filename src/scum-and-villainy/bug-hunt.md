title: Bug Hunt
---

The Crew are tasked with hunting down and killing a **Lithitrant**, a floating whale native to **Vet**. Unfortunately, not everything is as it seems.

## Contact

The Crew are contacted by their primary source for work with a possible job on **SB-176**, the mining station that orbits **Vet**, a gas giant in the **Rin** system. All the contact knows is the job is for the **Guild of Engineers** and they’re paying **6 CRED** for what they term a “bug hunt”.

If they’re interested they should head to **SB-176** and speak to Primarch Jor, the regional head of the Guild.

## SB-176

**SB-176** is filled with unhappy miners. The atmosphere is one of subdued anger throughout the station. The Guild has recently stopped using Urbots due to the cost of replacing them and human workers are being used instead. **Primarch Jor** has made this change to bolster his profits, though he has declared it a temporary measure.

Standard credits are no good on **SB-176**. The only currency readily accepted here is the **GEMU**---the *Guild of Engineers Monetary Unit*. This can be traded at any of the automated facilities. **1 CRED** can be converted to **1 GEMU**, but converting **2 GEMU** gets you **1 CRED** back. This is one of the many ways the Guild maintains control of its workers.

If they spend any length of time in the public areas, such as the *Guild of Engineers Approved Drinking Venue*, otherwise known as the bar called **Geadv**, they will be contacted by **Bolt**, a labour organiser and general rabble-rouser and malcontent. He is most concerned about **Platform 17**---the most recent one which was damaged and has been declared missing. He’s got a couple of months savings which he’s happy to pay them to find out what happened to the people there. Of course, this is **2 GEMU**, not **CRED**.

## The Job

They can gain an audience with **Primarch Jor**, who introduces himself as **Yast**. He has an office in the more luxurious part of the station, which is slovenly and unkempt. He comes across as very friendly, relaxed, but genuinely doesn’t care about the life of his staff. When they meet him he is accompanied by his security chief, **Commander Saranah Rosson**, who he introduces as **Sara**. She is stern and business like and hates being addressed by anything except her rank and surname. She doesn’t appear to think much of **Yast** and will frequently roll her eyes when he speaks.

**Yast** has a problem with what he calls a *Vettan Space Whale* destroying mining platforms within the atmosphere of **Vet**. He wants the Crew to destroy it and will offer them **6 GEMU** to complete the task. He will be easy to convince to raise the price to **8 GEMU** but hard to convince to pay them in **CRED**.

**Commander Rosson** can provide them details of the last attack and the nature of the Vettan Whale.

### Platform 17

The location last remaining mining platform is `Finish`

The mining platform is not as damaged as it should be and there are still people on board. Guns train on them if they attempt to dock. The platform is on lockdown and the workers are fighting with the crew

### The Vettan Space Whale

The **Lithitrant**, or *Vettan Space Whale*, reaches a length of 2--5 kilometres. It floats within the dense atmosphere of **Vet**, which hosts many creatures flying through its gaseous atmosphere. It is a long cylindrical creature with armour plating along its top and a dozen flippers along each flank. It is generally timid and subsists on thick clumps of gas.

**Lithitrants** are attuned to the *Way* and communicate with each other through empathic messages.

**Kasumi**, the person **Bolt** is looking for is currently living on the back of the whale. She has been directing it to damage the mining platforms.

###### Notes

They’re on a bug hunt. The target is a giant beast of some sort. The location is a hot desert world where a lot of mining happens. Some tech has trouble functioning because of the heat, sand and electro-magnetic storms. The mining operation is at a standstill because of the beast attacks. The crew have been brought in to clear the area of the creature so mining can continue.

What they don’t know is the mining standstill is actually caused by the miners striking due to unsafe conditions and many deaths at the mine. The company actually treats them as slaves and doesn’t care about the deaths. The striking miners have a leader somewhere and they are somehow controlling the creature(s) who are preventing the company’s hit squad taking them out.
