title: The Red Knuckle Gang
---

The Red Knuckle Gang are a group of small time crooks who work for the highest bidder. They’ve completed jobs for the Hutts and Black Sun and, occasionally, the Zann Consortium. They show no real loyalty to any side but their greed and spice addiction make them predictable. The gang are known as hackers and intrusion experts but aren’t adverse to smuggling or extortion jobs, if the price is right.

## Introduction

The Red Knuckle Gang has kidnapped a young Rodian woman called Mado Tanwa. Mado is the daughter of Annik Tanwa, a wealthy businessman and owner of several manufacturing facilities throughout the Savareen sector. Annik has been in contact with the Red Knuckle Gang and agreed to pay 50,000 credits for the safe return of Mado and has travelled to Kwenn Station at the edge of Hutt space to make the exchange. However, when the appointed time came, the Red Knuckle Gang didn’t show.

### Involving the Player Characters

Annik Tanwa is offering a reward of 10,000 credits for the safe return of Mado. In addition, each member of the Red Knuckle Gang has a bounty of 2,000 credits, wanted alive, across many different sectors. If the player character’s are the type to be motivated by a cash reward then Annik contacts them, either through their regular agent or directly, if they don’t have one.

Annik Tanwa is a fervent supporter of the Rebel Alliance and has allowed them to use his manufacturing facilities in the past. He has spoken to his regular Alliance contact and implored them for aid in the matter. He is a valued ally but desperate for the return of Mado, possibly desperate enough to jeopardise his relationship with the Rebellion. The player characters have been tasked by their Alliance liaison or commander to aid Annik in any way they can.

However the player characters come into contact with Annik, he can provide them with holo images of three of the gang members: Ringer, Thumb, and Pinky; along with the name of their ship: *The Myttian Fist*; and its last known location: Empress Teta.

SIDEBAR

If the Game Master feels the credit rewards are too high then tracking down each and every core world security force that has an outstanding warrant on the Red Knuckle Gang could become an adventure itself.

## The Red Knuckle Gang

The Red Knuckle gang consists of six people, all of whom use code names during their work. The gang changes frequently, with old members growing wary of the work and new members joining. The current group consists of rodians, humans, duros, and weequay. However, the code names of the gang members remain the same. These are:

- Arch
- Cutey
- Nail
- Ringer
- Thumb
- Pinky

Arch is the current leader of the Red Knuckle Gang. Although she has only been an on and off member of the gang for the past year, under her leadership and intelligence the gang has thrived. Arch is, of course, Mado Tanwa, daughter of Annik Tanwa. Her pampered existence as the daughter of a wealthy businessman bored her, leading her to seek out a life of thrilling crime as part of the Red Knuckle Gang.

### Things the Player Characters Might Know

It’s possible that the player characters may have heard of the Red Knuckle Gang, beyond the information Annik provided them with. An Average (pp) Knowledge (Underworld) or Computers check could provide some or all of the following information:

- The Red Knuckle Gang are small time with six members
- They have no loyalties, working for the Hutts or Black Sun or whoever will pay their bills
- They do a lot of high-tech work, mainly break-ins of secure facilities
- They’re heavy spice users
- Their ship, *The Myttian Fist*, is a ZH-25 *Questor* Class Light Freighter
- *The Myttian Fist* is on lockdown on Empress Teta

`TODO break this into a table of success / failure / threat / advantage / triumph / despair`

## Empress Teta

Empress Teta is a densely populated planet in the Empress Teta system of the Koros sector. It sits within the Deep Core region close to Coruscant and is known for its carbonite mines and andris spice. Like Coruscant, the surface of Empress Teta is covered in a planet-wide city called Cinnagar. While technically ruled by a monarchy, the true power on the planet is the Mining Guild and its Imperial overlords. An Average (pp) Knowledge (Core Worlds) check could provide the player characters with more information on Empress Teta and its history if the Game Master wishes.

Empress Teta is a well known world and travelling would usually be straightforward. However, recent changes to astronavigation charts have begun to use Cinnagar, Empress Teta, and Koros, an old name for the planet, interchangeably. This has caused some confusion for travellers. When the player character’s travel to Empress Teta they should make an Average (pp) Astrogation check with 2 setback dice.

SIDEBAR

More details concerning Empress Teta can be found in Nexus of Power on page 60 or on the Empress Teta page on Wookieepedia. If a different Core World would better suit the story then the Game Master should feel free to substitute one that is more appropriate.

### Finding the Red Knuckle Gang

The Red Knuckle Gang are lying low at the Golden Coronet, a luxury hotel at the heart of the Core District of Cinnagar. They are staying in one of the more expensive suites for the past week using funds Mado Tanwa stole from her father. Their ship, *The Myttian Fist*, is impounded at the nearest spaceport due to outstanding warrants on the gang members. While they’re living the good life on her father’s money, Mado is attempting to acquire fake identity chips and ownership details for their ship so they can depart.

Finding the Red Knuckle Gang can be approached in many different ways by enterprising player characters. The public shipping records could be accessed with an Average (pp) Computers check to find *The Myttian Fist*. Alternatively an Average (pp) Charm check to sweet-talk the Spaceport Administrator or an Average (pp) Knowledge (Core Worlds) check could obtain the same information.

Once the player characters know the whereabouts of *The Myttian Fist* it’s a simple matter to locate its crew. With a bit of legwork and an Easy (p) Streetwise check the player characters could canvas the surrounding area with the the holo-images they obtained from Annik Tanwa. A success on the roll would have a citizen recognise Pinky as regularly leaving the Golden Coronet while a fail with one or more Advantages or a Triumph could lead the player characters to a few streets that Pinky has been spotted at. 

More tech-savvy player characters might try to to scour the local network for traces of Mado Tanwa. This requires a Hard (ppp) Computers check with a success revealing her credit information was used to book a suite at the Golden Coronet. A failed roll with one or more Advantages or a Triumph could give the player characters some shops and bars in the area where Mado Tanwa’s credit chip has been used, including the bar at the Golden Coronet.

Knowing the gang’s reputation for spice addiction some player characters might look to criminal contacts for information. A successful Average (pp) Knowledge (Underworld) or Streetwise check would reveal a Duros called Cadan Keeg as the person to talk to if you need spice. He can be found in the The Krath’s Head most evenings. A failure with one or more Advantages or a Triumph could lead the player characters to The Krath’s Head but not the person they need to speak to. Once they’ve found Cadan Keeg they’ll need to get the information they need from him. Cadan doesn’t know anything about the Red Knuckle Gang but does know Pinky. Cadan made his first spice sale to Pinky a week ago and he’s been coming to The Krath’s Head every couple of days since then. How the player characters get this information from Cadan is up to them. Cadan doesn’t usually give out information about his clientele but a display of force or a bribe would win him around.

Multiple Threats or a Despair on any of the rolls to find the gang could lead to them being tipped off about the people pursuing them. The Red Knuckle Gang could prepare for an assault, steal their own impounded ship and flee or even find and attack the player characters directly.

### The Golden Coronet

The Golden Coronet is an up market hotel in the centre of the Core District. It is extravagant and flamboyant, built on a grand scale, and exudes wealth and riches. Gold adorns every available surface and the golden coronet motif of its name is embossed wherever possible. The hotel is guarded by golden security droids who all bear the coronet crest. There are two stationed on every floor, with more on the ground floor and an almost limitless supply powered down in the basement.

The Red Knuckle Gang have hired a suite on the 30th floor of the building. They have six separate rooms with en-suite bathrooms all off a central lounge area. Most of the gang stay within the confines of the rooms, except for Pinky who makes frequent spice runs, and Cutey and Nail who can often be found in one of the hotel’s many bars.

Getting into the Golden Coronet is as simple as walking in through the marble-arch that makes up the doorway and across the expanse of the lobby. Getting through security and above the ground floor is much more difficult. Without a key card the player characters will not be given access to higher levels. Hiring a single room for the night would be the simplest way to gain access and cost 500 credits. Bribing a receptionist to allow them access would be cheaper with an Average (pp) Charm check. A minimum of 100 credits would be needed for the bribe, with larger amounts granting boost dice to the check.

Pick-pocketing a key card from a paying guest could be achieved with an upgraded Average (rp) Skulduggery check. One or more Threat or Despair on the roll may attract the attention of two Security Droids. Bypassing the security systems to open the doors could be achieved with a Hard (ppp) Computers or Skulduggery check. One or more Threat or Despair on the roll could activate a silent alarm and send security droids in their direction.

Once through security the player characters are ready to face the Red Knuckle Gang. The suite Mado Tanwa has rented for her gang is huge. The central room is circular and a little over Medium range across with a sunken area in the centre. The sunken area is down three steps and contains several sofas and a low table which can be used for cover. The far wall is filled by a transparisteel window offering a panoramic view of the city of Cinnagar. To the left is a bar which can provide additional cover. On shelves above the bar are many different kinds of liquor from across the galaxy, some quite rare and exotic, and many of them combustible. In addition to the entrance there are six doors leading off the lounge area. These lead to identical bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms.

All going well the Red Knuckle Gang will be in the lounge area when the player characters arrive. If they’re unaware of the player character’s approach they will be sitting around, talking, drinking, taking spice while Arch hacks the local network to create new identities for herself and the rest of the gang. If the gang is aware of the player character’s approach then they will have prepared cover using the sofas and tables and positioned two of the gang either side of the entrance. If they know who the player characters are and are suitably awed by their previous exploits the gang will even prepare some rudimentary firebombs from the liquor above the bar. In either case the gang’s goal will be to eliminate their enemy if they can or escape if they can’t.

One thing that might surprise the player characters is there is no obvious hostage for them to rescue. In fact, the person they’re trying to rescue is the leader of the gang.

## Denouement

Once the player characters have captured the gang they need to decide what to do with them. When they find out Arch is Mado Tanwa they have a choice to make. They can make more money by turning Mado and the rest of the gang in but Annik Tanwa offered them a reward for the safe return of his daughter, not for her spending the next ten years in an Imperial hard labour camp. The Rebel Alliance may also have something to say if one of their supporters suddenly decides to retract his support.
