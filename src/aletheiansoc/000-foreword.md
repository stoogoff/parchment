As a rule I’m not much for yarns; when one has lived a life so positively chock-full of adventure as I have, one hardly needs to be regaled with fictional accounts in order to conjure up images of the dreadful and gingery variety.  However, when the Tribune first asked me to contribute to this book, I took it upon myself to distill down a lifetime’s wisdom and experience into a modest entry of slightly more than eight hundred pages.  Congratulating myself on a job well-done, I sat back, poured myself a brandy and waited for the royalty monies to roll in.

You can imagine then my bitter regret at having wasted so much of my extremely valuable time when the noxious harpy of an editor insisted that not only was my masterpiece to be slashed to ribbons, but indeed that the scribblings of other, lesser writers were to take the place of my own handsome quill-work!  All of her vapours about how this was intended as a way of introducing new illuminates to the business of the Society, and that there was value to presenting different perspectives left me cold.  Having tasted the rotten apple of editorial oversight I found it deuced bitter and vowed then that I would never again apply myself to prose.

It was, of course, an extra slap in the face to be instructed to write the foreword to a tome from which the majority of my own words had been banished.  My heart goes out to the young illuminate, flushed with excitement at the sight of my name on the cover, who then finds themselves wading through the literary dross that the rest of this folio represents.  Weep for the book you could have been holding in your hands if only cruel fate and the vexatious red pen of the malicious proofreader had not denied it to you!

As it is I’m sure this screed will suffice for holding up a wobbly table leg or swatting flies, but I cannot under any circumstances recommend using it as reading material.

Yours regretfully,

<span>Dr Hieronymus Cadwallader</span>

p.s. I might add that I am yet to see a penny of royalties!
