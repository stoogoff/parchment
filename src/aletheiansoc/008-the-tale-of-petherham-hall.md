### I. Arrival

William was laid out along the entire length of the seat, his head propped up on his folded jacket with his bowler on his chest. Low snores emanated from beneath the Fortnightly Review covering his face. The Chaptermaster, Lord Ambrose Havelock, sat opposite him, reading the Illustrated Police News and occasionally chuckling. 

For her part, Julia was again attempting to learn to knit. Her aunt claimed it was relaxing, but as always it merely frustrated her. She threw the needles down in disgust and went back to staring gloomily at the Yorkshire countryside.

“Why are we in Yorkshire?” she said suddenly. “You still haven't explained. And don't say because I received a telegram again.”

Ambrose looked up, surprised, as if he had forgotten she was there. He blinked at her owlishly for a second. “Because I received a telegram,” he said. He registered her expression, and his brain caught up with his ears. He looked rueful. “Ah, yes, sorry. To expand, I received an urgent telegram from someone to whom I—”

“We,” interrupted an emphatic voice from beneath the Fortnightly Review.

“Sorry Bill, yes, someone to whom _we_ owe a serious debt. It demanded our attendance as soon as possible.”

“Is that why the others are on their way to Plymouth and we're on our way to Leeds?”

“Yes. We'll catch up with them as soon as we're done. I don't imagine it will take long.”

William lifted raised his head and gave Lord Havelock a skeptical look. The Chaptermaster shrugged.

“Well, I'm basing that on nothing in particular if I'm honest. Amelia didn't say anything about what exactly she wanted, obviously. Not in a telegram. Either way, I'm confident the others can hold down the fort until we get there. It's only a giant glowing dog, after all!”

William grunted.

“Who is Amelia?” asked Julia after a moment.

“Lady Amelia Petherham,” said Havelock absently. “The wife of—”

“Of Sir Edmund Petherham, presumably.” interrupted Julia, feeling pleased with herself. “Don't look so surprised. I've read the list of names in the library you know. There's less than a dozen of them, and they're reasonably easy to remember.”

Havelock continued to stare at the Illustrated Police News, avoiding looking at her.“Yes. Poor Eddie's widow. She really doesn't like me, you know, so if she's demanding I come see her I imagine it's something serious.”

He stood up then suddenly, dropping the lurid “newspaper” on his seat. “Now if you'll excuse me, Miss Garvey, I'm going to go and see if I can find a guard and inquire how much longer we're going to be on this train.” He slipped out of the carriage with a decisive look on his face, stumbling slightly from the movement of the train.

Julia sighed heavily. “Arrogant arse.” she muttered under her breath. “Sometimes I think he just keeps secrets for the sake of it.”

“Aye, that's fair enough,” said William. 

Julia hadn't realised she'd spoken loud enough for him to hear, and immediately felt guilty.

The big man sat up, yawning. “But tha mustn't forget,” he continued. “That we're all members of a secret society sworn to protect t'common folk from t'invisible world. There's no place in t'Aletheian for people as writes to t'newspapers after every investigation, blabbing on about spooks and goblins, is there lass?”

“I suppose not,” she said, feeling a little admonished. “But if we're heading into danger the least he could do is warn me about it.”

The Yorkshireman tugged at one of his ginger sideburns, a nervous tic she'd come to associate with him giving something careful consideration. After a moment he nodded to himself. “Our Lady Petherham blames t'society for what happened to her beloved Edmund,” he said. “Swore that she'd never have owt to do with us again, banned us from t'house right after t'funeral. It were all very sad – even allowin' for t'fact it were a funeral.”

“And was the society to blame?” 

William considered his response while he pulled on his jacket and wedged his hat onto his head. “Pretty much,” he said as he stood up. “Aye. We were pretty much t'blame as it happens.”

He gave Julia an unreadable look, pausing as if he might say something else, but then changed his mind. He slid the carriage door open and paused for a moment, feet planted firmly against the swaying of the train.“But hopefully it'll have nowt to do with all that, and we'll be on our way t'join t'others in t'morning. Mebbe she's changed her mind. Either way, I'm off t'find Ambrose and make sure he's not annoying anyone. You might want t'have a nap, lass. We'll be in Leeds soon enough, and somethin' tells me we'll neither of us be getting' much sleep once we reach t'house.”


### II. Leeds

Leeds was crowded and dirty. There was a man waiting, and William arranged for some porters to transfer their luggage to his carriage. Julia was traveling light – everything packed in a trunk that had belonged to her father – and William rarely bothered to bring more than a case and his medical bag no matter how far they were traveling. Lord Havelock on the other hand seemed to have brought everything bar the kitchen sink. 

The man - Mister Blaylock as he introduced himself to William - shot Julia a dark look as he loaded the carriage, perhaps assuming that she was the reason for so many cases and boxes. She bridled, and might have said something, but she caught Lord Havelock looking at her with a half smile and a twinkle in his eye and decided it was not worth rising to the bait.

The carriage was comfortable enough inside - at least until they left the growing city behind for rutted and rucked country roads. It seemed clear that the wealth being generated by the burgeoning businesses was being spent with an eye towards the needs of the urban traveller, not the rural explorer. 

They didn't talk much, each lost in their individual thoughts. William cocked his hat over his face and dozed, while Lord Havelock stared out of the window, and it was up to Julia to break the silence again.

“Is there any reason we’re not calling in on the Leeds chapter?” she asked. “That would be protocol.”

Havelock waved a hand airily. “You know that protocol doesn’t apply to us, Miss Garvey.”

“Still. It would be good manners at the very least. Also someone there might have insight into… into whatever it is that has drawn us here.”

Lord Havelock favoured her with an amused glance.

“I doubt it. Amelia despises the Leeds chapter almost as much as she despises me. Also…” he cleared his throat and looked away from Julia at the beautiful Yorkshire countryside. “Also… the Leeds Chaptermaster said she’d skin me alive if she ever encountered me again, so I imagine we’d be unlikely to get a friendly welcome.”

Julia rolled her eyes.

“Is there anyone you haven’t offended, Havelock?”

He treated her to a lopsided smile, but didn’t reply. There were heavy, dark circles under his eyes and she wondered absently when he had last slept. She decided to change tack.

 “Why did you insist on my coming with you, Havelock? Why not send me to Dartmoor with the others – this is clearly some private matter between yourself, William, and Lady Amelia.”

The Chaptermaster frowned at her, looking a little surprised.

“I would have thought that was obvious,” he replied slowly. “I need you along in case something goes horribly wrong. The Tribune won't believe anything I have to say, but she'll trust you. Also, if you're here, your report can be complete and I don't see any value in giving her any more reason to be snooping around the chapter than she already has.”

Julia opened her mouth to say something sharp, thought better of it, and went back to her knitting. It was no easy proposition given how the carriage bounced and jolted but she persevered.

They spent the rest of the journey in silence, the only sounds an occasional muttered outburst from Mister Blaylock, and William’s regular, heavy snoring.




### III. A Cool Reception

Petherham Hall was a delightful country manor, set in several acres of reasonably well maintained parkland. Through the ornate ironwork gate, a wide driveway swept up towards the main doors. Rose bushes clamoured around the front of the house, and while the lawn looked a little ragged around the edges it was clear that someone too the responsibility of keeping it mowed very seriously indeed.

As they disembarked—William yawning and stretching widely—Mister Blaylock muttered something about them going inside as he started to unload their baggage. Lord Havelock lead the way up the shallow steps to the wide open doors, pausing briefly at the threshold for propriety’s sake before sweeping in as if he were an honoured guest.  

A woman who could only be Lady Petherham was coming down the stairs as they entered, her skirt held up in one long-fingered hand. Her black dress made the paleness of her skin even more apparent as she swept down towards the trio. Her expression was not welcoming. She stopped at the bottom of the stairs, lips pressed tightly together.

“Havelock,” she said. She stood ramrod straight, her head up, her hands crossed before her. Julia could not shake the impression that the dress, with its starched collar, severe lines, and tight corset, was the only thing keeping her on her feet.

Lord Havelock stepped forward, offering his hand. Lady Petherham made no move to take it.

“Believe me, if there were any other choice…” She let her words die away. Lord Havelock dropped his hand, his shoulders slumping slightly, although his face remained calm.

“Mother, please, these people are our guests.” The young man who accompanied the voice looked as if he had not been sleeping very well either. He crossed the room, and took Lord Havelock's hand, shaking it firmly.

“Uncle Havelock. Uncle Will.” he said. His smile seemed genuine, if strained.

“It's been too long,” said Havelock, smiling back at him. 

Julia was looking at Lady Petherham as her son greeted the two men, and saw her wince, as if each use of the word “uncle” was a slap.

“Not since the funeral,” agreed the young man. He reached out toward William, taking his hand as well. The big man clapped him on the shoulder. He winced slightly, but Julia didn't think any of the others noticed.

“Are you home from Carlinghouse?” asked Havelock.

“Finished,” said the young man with a rueful smile. “Deciding what to do with my life.”

His face fell, and his pleasant demeanour fractured slightly.

“Just as well I'm done with school, really,” he went on more somberly “Mother has been beside herself. She needs a man about the house and Victor is too busy in India or wherever to worry about the old estates. As usual.”

“I am right here, you know,” said Lady Petherham icily. “And I will not have you criticising your brother. Victor's work is very important; I am certain he will be here as soon as he can.”

“Sorry, Mother,” said the youth, hanging his head slightly. Then he seemed to spot Julia for the first time and he brightened up almost immediately, treating her to a dazzling smile.

“And who's this?”

“This is Miss Julia Garvey,” said Lord Havelock turning slightly. “My ward.”

He shot Julia a significant look which neither Lady Petherham nor her son could see. Julia arranged her features into a smile, and offered her hand. The young man took it and held it briefly. His own hand was very warm, she thought. A little clammy. His smile was beginning to look a little forced.

“Charmed,” she said. She was aware of Lady Petherham staring daggers at her, and broke the contact.

“Albert,” said their hostess cooly. “I need to speak to Lord Havelock and Doctor Morcambe in private I'm afraid. Can you make sure cook knows to set three extra places for tea?”

He didn't look pleased, but complied with his mother's request. With a backward glance, he disappeared along one of the carpeted hallways.

“Blaylock will take your things up to the guest rooms.” said Lady Petherham once they were alone.“Perhaps your… ward… would like to change for tea?”

Their hostess was pointedly ignoring Julia, and it was all she could do to stop herself saying something impertinent.

“Miss Garvey is a member of the Society,” said Havelock carefully. “Anything you have to say to William and me you can say to her also. I assume it is Society business we are here to discuss?”

Lady Petherham did not answer, nor did she look particularly pleased. Without another word she swept out of the room, with one brief backward glance to see if they were behind her. The three exchanged a look, and then followed her along a carpeted corridor.

“I swear that woman thinks I'm your… your damn mistress!” hissed Julia, barely able to contain herself.

Lord Havelock smothered a smile. He shook his head.

“Perhaps she does, but we both know that's not the case. Does it matter to you what she thinks?

Their hostess disappeared through a door ahead of them.

“Well… no. But… it's outrageous!”

William and Havelock shared a look, which infuriated Julia even more for some reason. She changed the subject.

“Who was the young man?”

“That were Albert.” said William quietly as they followed Lady Petherham into a nicely appointed morning room. “T'middle son. He'd be about seventeen, I reckon. Looks like he's takin' after his father. Good strong handshake.”

The drawing room was neat and richly appointed but had all the warmth and cheer of an empty cellar.

“Please, sit.” Lady Petherham's manner remained frosty. She had seated herself in a high backed chair with its back to the windows. The others found seats and settled down. There was a silver tea-service on a low table by her chair along with a plate of scones, but she made no move to pour.

“You must be wondering why I've called you here,” she began. “And you're right, it is about your beastly Society.”

“Amelia —” began Lord Havelock, but she cut him off.

“Lady Petherham, if you don't mind.” she snapped. “You lost every right to call me by that name when you… when your Society murdered my husband!”

“Edmund knew the risks,” Lord Havelock began. But he had misjudged how taut Lady Petherham's temper had been stretched. 

“Risks?” she snapped, her face colouring, her eyes filling with tears that she refused to allow to fall. “Don't talk to me about risks! He had responsibilities!”

For a moment, the ice cracked. A shudder wracked her body and for a moment it looked as if she might collapse entirely, falling in on herself - or perhaps explode outwards to launch herself at Havelock.

“Shall I pour?” said Julia quietly. She gestured to the tea things. Lady Petherham looked at her blankly for a moment, then something a little like gratitude showed in her eyes for a moment.

“Yes,” she said more calmly. “Please do.”

As Julia knelt by the table and began to pour the tea, Lady Petherham took advantage of the distraction to rein herself in and shore up her defences. There was no further discussion until everyone had a china cup and saucer in their hands. William looked a little mournfully at his – he much preferred a solid mug to a china cup – but he cheered himself up a little by adding enough sugar to let his spoon stand up straight.

“I never wanted the boys involved with your dreadful Society,” said Lady Petherham quietly. “Not after what it did to their father. To their uncle.”

“Aye, and we respected your wishes,” said William. Their hostess inclined her head slightly in acknowledgement, but continued to address herself to the Chaptermaster. Lord Havelock sipped his tea, his eyes hooded, his expression flat, saying nothing. 

“But now… Oh God. Now it seems I have no choice.” She took in a deep shuddering breath. “Something… something has found my son. I am at my wits’ end. Doctors are no help. The priest fled the house. I had no choice but to contact you. You! And your… and your Society.”

Havelock nodded slowly, as if this made perfect sense.

“I wondered,” he said. “I hoped time might have changed your mind about us—about letting Victor or Albert perhaps take their father's place. But then I remembered who I was dealing with. You were never one to change your mind. That left only one alternative explanation.”

Lady Petherham put her cup and saucer down, folding her hands in her lap with careful movements. She did not look at any of them as she began to speak, gazing instead into the distance.

“It started just over three weeks ago,” she began. “Georgie was at school, of course. The housemaster said his screams roused near half the town. They thought at first it was just a nightmare, but then the matron saw the marks. As soon as I heard I sent Albert with Blaylock to bring him home. I hoped that might help, somehow. I had Doctor Edmonton examine him, but he could find nothing to explain his symptoms. Then last week I begged Father Bishop to come, and he… well he was no help either.”

She looked down at her hands, then back up, meeting Lord Havelock's gaze steadily.

“Please, Ambrose,” she said. “If ever you loved my husband — I am begging you — help my son.”

### IV. Young Georgie

Georgie was sitting up in bed. He seemed lost in the pillows, his shock of black hair a stark  contrast to the wan paleness of his skin. His arms were outside the coverlet, and white bandages poked out from the sleeves of his pyjama jacket. His eyes were closed, but fluttered open as the company entered his bedroom. 

“Bill?” Lord Havelock jerked his head towards the bed. William stepped up smartly, giving the lad his best bedside manner.

“Who… are these people, mama?” asked Georgie. He sounded half-asleep, his voice weak. Lady Petherham put on a brave face, sitting in the comfortable chair next to his bed.

“They are old friends of your father,” she said gently. “Doctor Morcambe here is just going to take a look at you.”

The boy looked very unhappy, glancing several times at his mother for reassurance as the bluff Yorkshiremen took his pulse, checked his eyes and ears, and put his hand carefully on his forehead, nodding all the time. Then he asked Georgie to open his pyjama jacket. The lad didn't seem happy, but with fumbling fingers did his best to comply.

At the sight of the black and yellow bruises covering the boy’s chest beneath, William sucked his breath in. He gently prodded Georgie's chest with one thick finger, causing the patient to let out a high pitched yelp. Julia could see that Mrs Petherham was trying very hard indeed not to cry.

“That's champion, young master,” said William pleasantly. “But I'm going to have to take a look at your arms. Can you take your jacket off for me?”

Georgie nodded, but the trepidation was written on his face. As he struggled, William kept up a steady stream of innocuous questions—where he went to school, what his favourite classes were, who was his favourite teacher. His answers were noncommittal and vague, until William asked what he wanted to be when he grew up.

“I am going to be a doctor,” he said decisively. William quirked an eyebrow.

“And why's that, young Master?”

“Because doctors save lives.” He spoke with absolute certainty. Lady Petherham reached out and took his hand, holding it gently as William unwrapped the bandages from his patient's arm with surprising dexterity in his thick fingers. She looked over towards Lord Havelock.

“Georgie's sister…” she began by way of explanation. “She fell ill. Not long after her father… passed away. They both did. The doctors did their best… but in the end…”

Despite herself, Julia felt an almost overwhelming need to comfort this poor woman. So much tragedy in her life, it was little wonder she appeared so cold. 

Before she could move however, William swore—rapidly trying to cover it with a fabricated coughing fit. He'd unwound part of the bandage from Georgie's right arm, and even from where she stood Julia could see the dressing was sticky with blood.

“I reckon tha should come look at this, Ambrose,” he said.

Lord Havelock and Julia gathered close around the bed. William held young Georgie's arm gently, turning it left and right to show off the extent of the damage.

Vicious little circles, each no larger than a sixpence, covered his skin in a mass of livid, red marks. They wound around his arm from the wrist toward the elbow. Even as they watched, droplets of blood began to form on their surface, like crimson sweat.

“The other arm is the same,” said Lady Petherham dully. “The school thought he was doing it to himself, although he swore he was not. When Albert got there they had his wrists tied to the bed to stop him doing it. He shan't be returning there, I can tell you that much.”

“I'll need fresh dressin',” said William. “I assume t'doctor left some, aye?”

“On the dresser,” she said. “We change them daily. There's a sponge and water as well, to clean him.”

“Might as well take care of both at the same time then.” William set to work, carefully removing the dressing from the other arm, sponging both, and applying new bandages. Georgie winced several times, but remained quiet throughout.

“Good lad,” said William approvingly when he was finished, and tousled the patient's hair. He turned to Lady Petherham. “I've a few other questions, you Ladyship. Can we step out into t'hall for a spell? \
	She looked unhappy, but Lady Petherham nodded and the two left. As the door swung shut, Lord Havelock moved across to sit in the chair their hostess had just vacated.

“Did you really know Father?” asked Georgie weakly.

“I did indeed. We were the best of friends for years – since before you were born. Since before he met your mother. You probably don't remember me but I first met you when you were barely six months old. We were in India, you see, when news came that you had been born.”

As Havelock talked to the boy, Julia had a look around the room. At first little seemed out of the ordinary. Clothes and shoes in the wardrobe; toys in the toychest; books on the bookshelves; water and a pot of flowers by the bed along with a plate of slightly brown apple slices. She glanced out of the window. Georgie's room had a fine view of well-kept lawn and flowerbeds. A little distance away, though, she spotted another building half hidden by hedges.

“What's that?” she asked, interrupting. Man and boy alike stared at her. “The building over there behind the shrubs, I mean. What is it?”

“That's the summerhouse,” said Georgie slowly. “We're not allowed to go there. It's falling down, and unsafe.”

Next, she hitched up her skirts and got down on hands and knees.

“What's she doing?” asked Georgie sotto voce.

“She's having a look around your room,” answered Havelock breezily. “To see if there's anything here that might be making you sick. Now, tell me about these dreams you've been having that keep waking you up.”

She pulled up the counterpane, and squinted under the bed. A chamber pot stared back at her.

“Anything?” asked Havelock.

“Nothing so far,” she said shortly. She considered her next move for a moment, then moved to the head of the bed, pressing her cheek against the wall, and peered down behind the headboard.

“Bingo!” she exclaimed. “Havelock, we'll need to pull the bed out slightly I think. There's something back here.”

“We're not supposed…” began Georgie but Havelock paid no heed, grabbing the end of the bed and pulling it forward a little. Julia leaned forward, trying to wedge her hand down into the gap, then suddenly froze. She went across to the chest of drawers and rummaged around until she found a pair of socks. She slipped one of them onto her hand, to the mystification of young Georgie.

“One can never be too careful,” she said in a cheerful tone. Then she leant back against the wall and reached down with her ensocked hand, scrabbling for moment.

“Feels like… a little bag,” she said. “With a string. Someone's stuck it in place with… I think it's drawing pins… got it!”

She pulled the bag out with a triumphant flourish.

“Did you put this here, Georgie?”

He shook his head, eyes wide.

At that moment the door began to open. Julia pulled the sock off her hand, rolling it over the little bag as she did so, and tucked both into the sleeve of her blouse.

“What's going on here?” Lady Petherham crossed the room quickly. “Why is the bed out of place?”

“We were looking for signs of anything out of the ordinary,” said Havelock mildly. “It's only a few inches.”

Their hostess bristled, with a flash of her previous hostility

“Is Georgie in here all the time?” asked Julia. “I mean during the day?”

“No,” said Lady Petherham shortly. “Sometimes we put him in his grandfather's bath chair and take him out into the garden. He likes that. And then there’s bath time.”

Georgie blanched visibly, a quick spasm running through him.

“We've overtired him. I think I'm going to ask you to leave for the moment, I'm very sorry. He's not very strong at the moment.” She glared at them as if daring them to gainsay her, but they dutifully trooped out into the passage, closing the door behind them.

“Well?” said Havelock.

“The bruises on t’lad's chest. I've seen summat like em before. On a man as had had a bloody great python wrapped round him.” William shook his head in wonderment. “But that fellow had most of his ribs snapped afore we could get t’damn serpent off from round him. He died, for all that we killed the beast. But I'd swear t’bones under the bruising are fine. It's the damnedest thing – I don't know what's been going on but there ought to be a lot more damage to go with those bruises than there is.

“As to the rest… did you see how t’wounds on his arms were arranged? Like a ribbon almost. Or a  code—there's some odd bruising and all. Like a ligature mebbe.”

“Or an octopus.” 

Both men looked at Julia.

“The arms on an octopus have suckers, don't they? That's what those arms made me think of. Like an octopus had wrapped one of its arms round Georgie’s in some way. The wounds were like the ones you get when you suck very hard on your hand.

She mimed as she spoke.

“Why would you suck very hard on your hand?” asked Havelock, frowning. 

“To see what would happen, obviously.” she replied as if the question was the stupidest she'd heard all day.

“Octopus,” said William shaking his shaggy head. “On top of that, t’lad's not sleeping properly that much is clear. He's got no appetite either, and that worries me more. He's wasting away. You know what that means.” \
“You think something is preying on him then, Bill?” Havelock did not look surprised. William nodded.

“Aye. Reckon it might be like that Whitby business all over again mebbe. Anyroadup, there's no other obvious marks on t'lads body as I could make out. Oh, but t’mother tells me he's been throwing up. Not t’food as such—but it sounds like he's finding it hard to keep any drink inside him. Which is odd because there's no signs of dehydration or owt. Then there's t'nightmares.”

“Yes, the nightmares.” said Havelock. “He says he doesn't remember much about them except that he can't see anything, he's cold, he can't run, and he can't breathe, and he's aware of something watching him.”

“Buried alive?” suggested William thoughtfully. 

“The breathing and inability to move…” said Julia thoughtfully. “I've read about some similar cases. Night hags. Demons in the form of hideous old women that sit on the chest of their victim. That might explain the watching.”

Havelock nodded, while William shook his head at the horrors of the world. 

“Oh yes, and this of course.” Julia slipped the sock-covered bag out of her sleeve, and weighed it in her hand.

“Is that… a sock?” William looked as mystified as Georgie had.

“Well I don't have my mittens on me, do I?” she said a little haughtily. “And I'm not handling an unknown item of dubious provenance with my bare hands until I know what it is.”

“Very wise,” said Havelock approvingly. “Perhaps the window sill?”

They moved a short distance down the hall and with some careful handling and judicious use of the sock managed to get the bag open without touching it.

“It's not very heavy.” she said. “Just a little bag. You can see where someone's tried to seal it with wax. But not very effectively.”

The contents of the bag, spilled out onto the sill, turned out to be an amount of white crystals, a couple of nails, some slightly soggy bread, a shilling, some squashed seeds, some wood shavings, and a damp piece of folding paper.

“Well that's unexpected,” said Havelock. He picked up the piece of paper and unfolded it.

“Salt,” said Julia. “Iron, what looks like a damp communion wafer probably dipped in a font or some such, rose hips, and I would bet this shiny silver shilling that the wood is rowan,” said Julia.

“I would not take that bet,” said Havelock, showing her the contents of the square of paper. A carefully ruled grid of squares, six-by-six, with letters carefully drawn in each square. “It's a charm against bewitchment and sorcery.”

“But not a very good charm,” said Julia. “It's like someone had done a lot of reading about things that are meant to protect against evil magic and tried them all at once.”

“Do these things ever work?” asked William.

“Rarely. In my experience it all depends on how heavy the charm is, and how hard you hit someone with it.” said Havelock, humourlessly.






### V. A Hot Meal

Albert joined them in the dining room for tea. Blaylock and a red faced woman in a white apron served them tomato soup, followed by a hearty meal of roast beef and vegetables. Conversation was stilted, full of awkward silences and long pauses.

“So have you been home from Carlinghouse long?” asked Havelock. Albert pushed his peas around his plate.

“I've been deciding what to do, really.” he said after a moment. “I've not really got the smarts to go to university; half the masters said as much. All that reading! And Victor suggested I take a commission but frankly I'm not sure I'm cut out for the army. You were both in the army weren't you?”

Lady Petherham raised an eyebrow but said nothing. She barely touched any of the courses, sipping water and picking at the food like a bird.

“We were.” Havelock did not seem enthusiastic about the topic. He made a point of paying attention to his meal, but William chimed in regardless.

“It's where we first met,” said the normally dour Yorkshireman. “He'd tried to take a bloody great knife off someone by the sharp end and I were t’one had to try and sew him back up. Had a devil of a time getting him to lie still. We'd run out of everything, so in t'end I had to use a surgeon's hammer to keep him quiet.”

He mimed throwing a punch. A rare, sad smile broke across his features.

“It were a lot easier then,” he said quietly looking off into the past. “You knew which side you were on.”

“Good and evil?” said Lady Petherham. Her voice could have cut glass; she clearly did not appreciate this kind of conversation at the table.

“No, Lady. Us and them.” William's smile faded a little. He realised everyone was looking at him and cleared his throat noisily.

“Anyroadup,” he said. “That were a long time ago and I'm sure we're all happy nobody is shootin' at us any more.”

He attended to his roast beef with gusto, but Julia saw him throw a glance across to Havelock, and something passed between them. Albert was oblivious.

“It sounds awful,” he said. “I thought I might go into politics maybe? Or just help mother run the estate. It's a lot of work for one woman after all. Especially with Georgie…”

His voice faltered, and his air of bonhomie fell away. Havelock changed the subject.

“How is Victor doing? He's with the foreign office, isn't he?”

“How do you know that?” interrupted Lady Petherham suspiciously. 

Havelock ate some beef before responding. “I think someone must have mentioned his name to me,” he said mildly. “Nothing sinister, I promise you.”

Lady Petherham did not look mollified.

The meal was rounded out by a heavy suet pudding with extremely thick custard. William excused himself to go and stand in the garden and smoke his pipe, and Albert went with him. Blaylock and the woman who turned out to be Mrs Blaylock tidied the tea things away, leaving Lady Petherham, Havelock, and Julia alone together.

“We'll sit with the boy tonight, of course,” said Havelock. “The nightmares seem to be at the core of it.”

“Have you any idea…” She stopped, considering her words. “Is it… is it a demon? Is my poor baby possessed?”

Her face twisted. It was clear she hated discussing the supernatural, but that she had to ask. She had to know. It was not an unfamiliar attitude.

“Entity,” said Havelock. “We try not to say demon. It makes it too easy to fall into the trap of thinking in terms of Heaven and Hell. And I don't think he's possessed.”

Julia leaned forward in her chair slightly. “It sounds more like its an oppression than a possession,” she said carefully.

“What's the difference?” 

“A possession involves a… an entity… taking up residence inside a victim. An oppression is what we call it when the entity is tormenting someone from outside.”

“You've encountered this kind of thing before?” Lady Petherham looked at Julia for what seemed like the first time since she'd arrived. It was an appraising look.

“I have. Once. In Whitby as it happens, six months ago. A young man was being tormented by a creature. We managed to identify the beast and drive it off. Destroy it, even.”

“You did this?” Lady Petherham could not keep the surprise and incredulity from her voice.

“We did this,” replied Julia firmly. “Not just me. The Society. It's what we do. We save people from monsters.”

“That's what Edmund thought,” said Lady Petherham

Havelock started to say something but then thought better of it.

“You know we didn't even have a body to bury,” she said quietly, still staring at Julia. “Lost at sea, they told me. I knew it was a lie. So convenient.”

“Amelia…” Havelock tried to reach across the table to touch her hand.

“Don't.” She pulled away and stood.

“I'll get Mrs Blaylock to find you some blankets. Save my son, Ambrose. Or so help me I will curse you all the days of my life until the Devil himself comes to take you.” 

With that, she swept out of the room without a backward glance.




### VI. Preparation

They rearranged the furniture in Georgie's room after dinner. 

They'd dragged the bed into the middle of the room and fetched two extra armchairs from downstairs, or rather William and Albert had. The elder brother had rolled up his shirt sleeves and pitched in with the heavy lifting a little to Julia's surprise, while Havelock talked quietly to Georgie and Julia prepared some protection. 

Once everything was in position, Julia drew an unbroken ring of salt around the bed—rock salt, from her case—and placed silver coins and old iron nails around the perimeter. Georgie was sitting up in bed, drinking hot milk and honey, and watching everything with wide eyes. There was a little colour in his cheeks at all the excitement, but that just made him look feverish. Albert stood in the doorway and watched. He looked worried, and a little lost.

“Aren't you going to do a chant?” he asked when she'd finished. “Invoke some guardian angels or something?” \
	“No.” Julia replied shortly. Havelock snorted, and pretended to read his book. 

“I could sit up with you,” the young man had offered, speaking slowly. “Take my turn at watching?” All of Albert's careless bravado had fallen away. He twiddled nervously with the top button of his shirt with one hand, the other thrust into the pocket of his trousers. 

“That's quite all right,” Julia had replied, stepping carefully out of the circle and hitching up her skirts as she did so to ensure that the line remained unbroken. “I think the best thing you can do now is get some sleep.” \
	She had shut the door firmly in his face, then stood there for a few moments listening. After a minute or so, his footsteps faded down the corridor and Julia stepped back into the circle again.

“He just wants to help,” said Havelock. \
	“I'm sure he does,” she replied a little primly. “But he's likely to be more hindrance than assistance if anything does happen.”

“Perhaps.” Havelock pursed his lips as if he was going to say more, but thought better of it.

Julia might have said more herself, but she was suddenly aware of Georgie watching her from his bed, and settled for giving Havelock a significant look to which he seemed mostly oblivious. He settled down in his chair and picked up his book.

“What are you reading?” asked Georgie, a little sleepily. 

“It's research.” Havelock showed him the cover of the little clapboard book: Tales of the Yorkshire Dales. “Stories from all over Yorkshire going back hundreds of years. Would you like to hear one? \
	Georgie nodded. As Julia and William settled down into their chairs, Havelock began to read the story of Lake Gormire in a quiet, sonorous voice. By the time the Abbot had turned out to be the devil and the foolish Lord had plunged off White Mare Cliff to his death, Georgie was sound asleep.

“You'll ‘ave given t'boy nightmares,” commented William.

“Right now I doubt a bedtime story is going to hold a candle to what's already happening,” Havelock replied. They were both whispering so as not to disturb the boy. “And anyway, a  lesson about foolish pride and not taking people at face value is always useful for a growing lad.”

### VII. A Visitation

Chimes echoed through the house.

“Eleven 'o'clock,” said Havelock absently, with a glance at his pocket watch.

Julia opened one eye and glared at him. “We can all count, you know.”

“I thought you were asleep.” Havelock snapped his watch closed and slipped it back into his waistcoat pocket.

“How can anyone sleep at a time like this?” replied Julia testily.

Havelock looked pointedly at William and raised an eyebrow. The doctor was wrapped in a tartan blanket, head thrown back, mouth open and snoring gently in his chair.

“He doesn't count,” she whispered back. “I swear he could sleep through a brass band.”

“I've known him to sleep through artillery barrages,” smiled Havelock. “A grandfather clock and the threat of malign incursion from the nether realms can hardly compete. \
	Julia shifted in her seat and covered a yawn. Havelock hadn't moved from the seat next to the boy's bed; the book he had been reading lay face-down on the bedside table next to the dimly flickering lamp.

Georgie was asleep, but he did not seem to be getting much rest. His wan face glistened with sweat, his brows furrowed, and he turned his head from side to side muttering occasionally. Julia stood, stretched, and moved across to lay a careful hand on his forehead. It was cold and clammy, his eyes flicking back and forth behind his eyelids.

“How long has he been like this?” she asked.

“About half an hour,” Havelock whispered back. “It's hard to tell if these are nightmares or something more sinister.” \
	“Have you tried waking him?” \
	“Not yet. He doesn't seem to be in any immediate danger and we're here to learn as much as we can.” \
	Julia wasn't entirely happy, but didn't challenge him, turning instead to examine the ring of salt.

“Why didn't you want young Albert to stay?” Havelock asked suddenly.

“He's a knowlessman,” she said after a moment's consideration, “and if anything does happen, we'll likely have our hands full with that without having to deal with a member of the public as well. She paused, thoughtful, smoothing her skirt. “Also I don't altogether trust him. There's something about him rubs me up the wrong way and puts my teeth on edge. He's taking this all too well, for a start. Also that jolly bonhomie he keeps putting out – it doesn't feel right.”

Havelock nodded thoughtfully and rubbed his chin.

“I know what you mean, Miss Garvey. He reminds me a little too much of his —”

“This isn't good,” interrupted Julia. Her tone of voice brough Havelock to his feet and over to where she was kneeling.

“The coins,” she said pointing. “They're turning black.”

They were indeed—the silver darkening and smudging. Julia reached out to touch one but caught herself just in time. She stood up quickly.

“William!” said Havelock urgently, turning to shake the third of their company awake.

“Is it midnight already?” asked the big man sleepily.

“No—it’s ten past eleven. Something is happening.”

The red-headed Yorkshireman was instantly awake, standing, and hefting a stout cudgel.

“Ten past eleven?” he said incredulously. “What kind o'demon turns up at ten past eleven instead o'midnight?”

“This kind, it seems,” said Julia, “Look at Georgie!”

The youngest Petherham boy was sat bolt upright in bed. His eyes were still closed but his mouth was opening and closing as if he were trying to speak. Spasmodic convulsions shook his tiny frame, and he began to make the most disturbing low moaning noise.	

William immediately tried to move to his side. “What the bleedin' heck!” he ejaculated – but his voice was muted as if he were on the far side of the room rather than no more than arm's reach from his companions. “I can't barely move! What's goin' on, by the Devil!” It was true. It was as if the air was thickening by the moment—trying to move was like wading through treacle. 

“The light!” cried Havelock. It was getting darker; the lamp was still lit but the circle of light it provided was shrinking. \
	“My case!” Julia turned in slow motion, her skirts and her hair spreading and twisting around her in an unnatural way as she forced herself through the gelid atmosphere toward her chair. “There's a candle—” \
	“Oh my God,” said Havelock quietly, gazing past them both, eyes wide and mouth hanging open in horror. As Julia grabbed the white candle out of one of the inner pockets, she turned to look.

The far wall of the bedroom was just… gone. From corner to corner, there was nothing there. Or not gone, not really. She should have been looking into the adjoining bedroom but instead there was only darkness, an utterly profound blackness that seemed to be sucking in all illumination from the room. Worse, it seemed to be spreading, pouring into the room as the light from the lamp shrank down to a ring barrely illuminating the table on which it stood.

The flowing night brought with it a stench—an almost overwhelming smell of something foul that Julia could not put into words. She covered her mouth with her hand, fighting to keep her supper down as she scrambled in her case for a match.

“He's having a fit!” shouted William from somewhere nearby, but the words seemed distant and barely relevant. She had no time to help either of them anyway—a primordial, atavistic fear of the dark was rapidly overtaking her. Her entire world had collapsed down to the white candle and the little airtight box of matches. With numb fingers she fumbled the box open, struck one of the matches—while the flame itself was visible it produced no actual light—and in an endless moment that seemed to stretch for hours but was in truth perhaps no more than two heartbeats, she touched the flaming head to the wick of the white candle.

Immediately, light poured out. Julia had shut her eyes but even through her lids the light as nearly blinding. It subsided after a moment, and she cautiously opened her eyes a crack. William was still leaning over the bead, covering his eyes with one hand, swearing foully under his breath. Havelock had his back to the rest of them, staring into the darkness.

Within the ring of salt, the light from the candle was bright and golden. The stench had gone, replaced by the sweet, reassuring, overwhelming scent of beeswax. Julia fancied she could hear chiming bells and gentle buzzing on the edge of hearing, and the warm tickle of late Summer sun on her skin. Beyond the ring, it fell away almost immediately to a sullen wan glow like the last minutes of twilight.

The wall of blackness still occupied the far side of the bedroom; it possessed an eerie geometric precision—a rectangle of absolute darkness. By itself, it was unnatural enough, but it was not the only thing that caught her eye. China ornaments and cloths had left their accustomed spots on top of the chest of drawers and were floating gently upwards toward the ceiling along with a cushion. The curtains undulated sluggishly. As she watched a blue slipper rose off the floor, lazily rising until it was about head height, spinning gently.

“Ouch!”She tossed the burned out match away from her with a flick of her wrist and sucked her singed fingers. The spill of wood moved sluggishly, slowly spinning. As it passed over the edge it stopped falling and followed the little slipper up toward the ceiling.

“It's water,” said Havelock, his voice full of awe, his face ashen. “We're underwater.”

“How are we breathing?”

“I don't know. I'm not sure this is entirely real, Miss Garvey.”

“Seems real enough!” grunted William. Georgie had stopped spasming, but was still sitting ramrod straight in bed. The big doctor carefully peeled open one of his eyelids, and muttered another oath. The eye beneath was rolled so far back that only the ivory-white sclera showed.

“This ain't good,” he said. “This ain't good at all, Ambrose. He's cold as ice, and he's sweating like a pig. He's barely breathing, either. We need to get the lad out of here and pretty damn quick.”

“We can't move him yet,” Havelock had not taken his eyes off the square of blackness. “I don't want anyone stepping outside the ward. It seems to be holding at least some of this back, whatever it is, and until we know more…”

Something moved in the blackness. Julia gasped. She couldn't say with certainty how she knew, but she knew it was something big. Something immense. Something coiling, or uncoiling, or roiling. She had lost all sense of perspective. 

The primitive part of her brain was screaming at her to run, but took a firm grasp on it and made it behave—although it took all her willpower and she still took an involuntary step back the Summer Candle wavering in her trembling grasp.

“Something’s coming,” she said, and another part of her brain was irritated by how weak and quavery her voice sounded.

Something indeed. It stepped out of the rectangle of blackness that had been one wall of Georgie's bedroom. Peripherally it looked human, but not convincingly so. It had the appearance of a woman—bare naked—with long golden hair cascading down from her shoulders and drifting around her head like a crown of tendrils. There was something wrong with its mouth—it protruded slightly giving the features the slight suggestion of something simian. Its eyes gave it away, however. They were empty pools of fathomless black.

It stopped suddenly, and glared at the three of them with eyes that might not have been eyes at all, just holes drilled into its head. It hissed, revealing why its mouth was so misshapen, its lips peeling back to display a twisted thicket of sharp protruding teeth more like curved bone spines than anything ever found in a human mouth.

“What isssss this?” it said. It was hard to hear, that voice. It sounded sonorous, melodic even, but beneath that was an undertone of grinding rocks that made it painful to hear. 

Havelock set his shoulders, squaring up to the thing that looked like a woman.

“Identify yourself!” he demanded, his voice even. Julia was impressed in spite of herself. Although his face was still ashen pale, the master of the chapterhouse allowed no hint of fear or uncertainty to leak into his words. “In the name of the Light Eternal, I command you to speak your name, creature!”

The thing hissed again, its mouth widening unnaturally, spreading across its lower face to reveal even more teeth.

“I am not yourssss to command little man.” 

Julia realised it was laughing. It moved forward another step. There as something… wrong with the way it moved. Julia realised she couldn't be sure if it was walking, It moved like it as gliding. Or sliding. She squeezed her eyes shut, taking a deep breath, willing herself to see what was really there.

“Name yourself and your purpose,” Havelock was not taking no for an answer. The hissing laughter came again.

Julia opened her eyes wide and stared straight at the thing, and for a heartbeat the light of the Summer Candle illuminated something entirely different.A scaled torso with coiling arms supported not by shapely legs but by a solid fused mass of blubber, scales, and fins that extended behind it into the darkness.

The thing glided forward another step. The dark wall behind it seethed and boiled.

“Come no closer, creature,” Havelock commanded. He held up one hand, spread wide. Woven between his fingers was a silver chain from which hung an antique medallion inscribed with peculiar sigils. “Depart this place, and leave this house untroubled.”

The thing seemed unimpressed.

“You put too much faith in trinketssssss,” it whispered. “They will not avail you againssst sssuch asss me.”

It slid forward. It was now within arm's reach. While it still appeared human, it managed to simultaneously give the impression of vast bulk,as if it were a giant seen at a distance rather than a curvaceous woman less than a yard away. It was staring into Havelock's eyes now, a smile quirking around its features. Despite its unnaturalness, part of Julia's brain was aware that it was also beautiful, alluring, even, in its nakedness. Yet at the same time, it exuded danger, hunger and madness.

It held out its arms, undulating and shifting its body.

“Come to me, man.” it said quietly, its voice dripping with salacious invitation. Havelock ignored it, although he let his hand drop.

“Less of that,” he said a little primly. “I can assure you that your undeniably ample—and quite obviously glamorous—charms are wasted on me and my companions.”

The thing snarled then, letting loose an awful screeching roar that could not have come from a human throat. For a moment the facade of beauty and humanity slipped. revealing something entirely different and entirely more horrifying. Julia bit her lip to prevent herself from crying out, hard enough to draw blood. Havelock took a deep shuddering breath and said something shocking under his breath in Latin.

Julia turned her face away and saw that William was continuing to completely ignore the entity, his entire attention focused on Georgie. The boy was doubled over, retching. William was supporting his body, pounding his back as he vomited onto his blankets. Pint after pint of filthy water and bile spewed from the boy’s mouth. She was aware that the Yorkshireman was shouting something but she couldn't make out what it was.

She glanced at the candle then—already half burnt. The substance of the Summer Candle evaporated rather than melting, which was just as well as the dripping hot wax of a conventional candle would by now have burnt her hand quite badly.

“Havelock,” she cautioned, drawing his attention. “We don't have a lot of time left.”

“You have no time, mortal woman,” scoffed the entity. “You are lesss than an eyeblink, lesss than a heartbeat, lesss than a breath. Gone within momentsss and lossst forever.”

“Leave Georgie alone,” said Julia. She unconsciously moved the candle so it was between her and the creature. Its light steeled her spirit and made her words steadier than they had any right to be. “We won't let you hurt him any more.”

“Sssoon the boy will be done.” The thing peeled back its lips, revealing row upon row of  vicious, jagged triangles rather than the thicket of spears it had held earlier. “Then the mother. Then the other brother and then… then who knowsss where the twisssting spiral and the great ocean will take me?”

Malice poured from it in waves. It moved forward again, stopping at the very edge of the ring of salt. It looked down, then back up, first at Julia, then Havelock, then past them to Georgie and William.

“Sssalt,” it said, hissing with laughter. “You ssseek to deny me with sssalt? I ssswim in sssalt, ssstupid mortalsss. The sssalt of the land. The sssalt of the sssea. The ssssalt in thisss boy'sss veinsss—in your veinsss. It isss all the ssssame. The sssame sssalt. The sssame depthsss. Look inssside and I am already there. I ssswim where I wish and no circle of sssalt will gainsssay me.”

The thing moved, then, suddenly. Its earlier movement, slow and steady, left them entirely unprepared for the speed with which it surged forward. The ring of salt dissolved into nothing as it crossed over it, as if it had been hit with buckets of water from all directions at once. As it dived it thrust outward with its arms sending both Havelock and Julia flying. The Chaptermaster hit the wall hard, while Julia crashed into the chest of drawers, shattering the mirror.

William turned, trying to shield the boy with his body.

“Get away from 'im, y'bastard!” he bellowed, bringing his cudgel round with crushing force towards the thing. The blow was solid, well aimed, with all his force behind it, but the cudgel simply snapped in two where it made contact with the creature's face. The six-foot Yorkshireman was picked up one-handed, and tossed aside as if he were a child. 

The candle was guttering, lying on its side. Luckily the golden flame that danced atop it had little interest in igniting anything else and could be extinguished only with milk or blood. Julia grabbed it and hauled herself to her feet, her head ringing. She tried to force her way toward the bed, with some half-formed plan to try and pull the thing away from its defenceless victim.

Crouching on the bed, the entity met her gaze, laughing, and then fell on Georgie. As it did so, it seemed to break apart into something akin to liquid, bloody darkness, crashing over the boy and the bed. Georgie convulsed once, twice, his mouth stretched wide in a silent scream. Blackness spread across his pyjama jacket, dark pearls drifting upwards.

With a crash, Julia lurched forward—suddenly able to move normally again —struggling to get her balance as the pressure that had been holding them all back was released. Light spilled back into the room, and without warning the bedroom door slammed open. Albert and Mr Blaylock stumbled into the room, and stood aghast. Behind them Lady Petherham and Mrs Blaylock appeared in the doorway, faces pale, eyes wide.

Georgie was  still screaming at the top of his lungs, thrashing from side to side. William—half of his face marked with a livid bruise and one of his eyes already swelling shut—tore open the boy's jacket revealing the bloody mess beneath. Mrs Blaylock fainted. Lady Petherham was shouting something, Albert was shouting, Mr Blaylock was glaring around horrified and while he was not shouting he was taking up a lot of space and trying to grab William’s arm. Julia's ears were ringing and she could not make sense of it.

Havelock, one hand pressed to his side, grabbed William's black bag and thrust it toward him. The doctor was bleeding himself—his nose was broken again, Julia thought absently—but he was all business.

“Get out!” he bellowed at the top of his lungs, while his thick fingers expertly threaded a vicious steel needle. “So help me, everyone 'cept Amelia get out and let me work! That includes you, Ambrose! Get 'em all out of here so I can work afore I clobber someone!”

Julia staggered forward, grabbing Mr Blaylock by the arm and dragging him toward the door. Dazed as she was, part of her had the presence of mind to dip two fingers in the pool on the bedside table where one of the mugs had been knocked over, pinching the wick of the Summer  candle with milk-covered fingers.

Havelock pulled Albert out of the room and slammed the door behind them. By this time Mrs Blaylock had recovered from her stupor enough to be hysterical.

“Everyone listen to me,” said Havelock firmly. “Mr Blaylock, take your wife down to the kitchen and pour her something to steady her nerves. In fact, I think we could all do with something to steady our nerves. Let William work, I'm sure he'll bellow if he needs anything. There's been enough excitement for one night, I think.”

Albert tried to ask him something but he held up his hand to forestall further interrogation.

“Not now,” he said shortly. “In the morning when we've had time to think. Now—brandy. Or cooking sherry if we haven't got any brandy.”

Without another word Lord Havelock limped off along the hall, exuding an unshakable conviction that he would all do as he instructed. And they all did.




### VIII. Aftermath

It had been close to one in the morning when William joined them in the kitchen, looking tired. He'd made a half-hearted attempt to wash the blood from his face and hands, but his shirt was soaked through, and it seemed he’d abandoned.his jacket and waistcoat already.

As soon as he came in, there was a babble of questions which he mostly ignored until he'd had a mug of something fortifying.

“He'll live,” William said simply. “We're lucky we were there though. He's lost a lot of blood has poor Georgie. He's sleeping now, and his mother's with him. The best thing to do right now is for everyone to get some sleep themselves, I reckon.” 

Nobody was entirely happy with this suggestion, but William insisted, and when anyone tried to argue he simply reminded them he was a doctor in a firm tone of voice that brooked no disagreement.

They held a council of war in William's room as the clock buried in the recesses of the house dutifully chimed three in the morning. It reminded Julia incongruously of her brief time at school; conspiratorial meetings by candlelight after everyone was supposed to be tucked up in bed, half a dozen girls giggling and whispering, packed into a tiny garret room. There was precious little giggling now, however.

Havelock sat next to William on the bed, his shirt untucked and his arm raised, wincing as the Yorkshireman carefully poked at his side. \
	“You're lucky,” was William's verdict. “Nowt's broken.”

He'd already examined Julia, making sure she could follow a finger and asking her a few stupid questions to reassure himself that she did not have a concussion.

“So what have we learned?” said Havelock, leaning back against the headboard.

“Well, we know it's probably something unnatural,” said Julia, deadpan. “So that's a good start.”

William guffawed, lighting his pipe. Havelock allowed himself a tired smile.

“Quite,” said Havelock. “What happened to the boy, Bill?”

William had cleaned his face, hands, and forearms in the washbasin, but was still wearing the bloodstained shirt. He sucked on his pipe for a moment or two before replying.

“It were a bite,” he said at least. “There's no two ways about it. Yon lad had been bitten by something. Something big.”

He bit down on the stem of his pipe and held his hands about eighteen inches apart. “It were about this wide at the widest point. Toothmarks front and back. Just a nibble mind you. Like it were tasting the lad. If it'd pulled, or chewed, or worried at wound it'd have bitten Georgie clean in half I reckon.”

They digested this for a moment.

“If we'd not been there….” William shook his head. “Most likely best not to dwell, but if we'd not been in t’room when it happened I think we'd have lost t’boy tonight. As it is, he'll need careful watching. He's a mere slip of a thing, and there's a lot that can go wrong with a wound like that on the brawniest man.”

“Did we make it worse?” Julia articulated something that had been bothering her for some time.

Havelock shook his head. “I don't think so,” he said carefully. “I think it did what it'd come to do. To be honest it seemed more amused than put out to find us there.”

“I think it's pretty clearly a sea creature,” he continued. “Oceanic. Benthic, even.” Nobody disagreed.

“The lad were spewing salt water,” said William. “Afore it bit him. Buckets of t’stuff. Bed were soaked even before all that blood.”

“You're sure it was salt water?” asked Havelock absently.

“Aye. Tasted it to make sure. Salt water and a bit of bile. More than a lad that size could fit in his belly. More than I could for that matter.”

“So that's another symptom of the oppression,” said Havelock. “It can't be a coincidence.”

“You're thinking of the father,” said Julia. “Given he died at sea, I'd guess there's a connection…”

William was shaking his head. “Except Eddie didn't actually die at sea,” he said. “We just told Amelia he did because it was… easier.”

“More lies?” said Julia icily. The two men had the good grace to look guilty. Havelock rallied quickly however.

“But the entire family think he died at sea, so we shouldn't discount a connection. What else?”

Julia looked down at her notebook. She'd spent the time in the kitchen constructively, writing while her memory was fresh as the others argued.

“Typical sea thing, I think,” she said. “Lots of common signs—glamour, seduction, scales, tentacles, shark teeth, protean, immense strength. It put me in mind of the Old Man of the Sea from the Sinbad story. It was a bit like a nereid from the Greeks, or one of those water spirits, but I think that was a trick.

“How so?” Havelock leaned forward, his eyes narrow.

“I'm pretty sure it was a lot bigger than it seemed,” she said. “I mean a lot bigger.”

“It were barely up to my shoulder, lass.” said William. Julia shook her head.

“No, that's what I mean. I think that was only part of it. The glamour was tricky—that's how glamours work—but I got the strongest impression that it wasn't a whole creature. If you looked at it right it was like something stretching part of itself through that wall of darkness into the room.”

She held up a finger and wiggled it around to illustrate her point. She took a deep breath and let it out slowly.

“I agree with Lord Havelock,” she said slowly. “Not everything that happened was entirely real. But I think… I think the other side of that wall of darkness was underwater. A long way underwater.

“Beneath the thunders of the upper deep,” quoted Havelock, “far, far beneath in the abysmal sea.”

Julia shivered.

“Yes. That's what I think it was,” she said, folding her arms around herself. “There was a dream-like quality to it all. Is Lord Tennyson part of the Society?”

Havelock gazed off into space, his expression unreadable.

“Nothing we did even slowed it down,” she continued when it was clear nobody was going to answer her. “We've got a list of qualities but we can't trust any of them beyond 'it's probably something to do with the sea'. I wish we had access to a good library. Do we have time…?”

She trailed off. William has shaking his head grimly.

“No chance,” he said. “Another attack will see that lad stone dead. It don't even need to be a bad'un like tonight. He's clinging to life by his fingernails already. And you heard what that thing said. The lad'll be used up soon. We can try to move him but right now I'm not sure he'll survive that, either.”

“I don't think it will help,” said Havelock, shaking himself and returning his attention to the room. “I didn't follow everything but I think it's the lad that's haunted, not the house. I think we'll be better off staying here—although it's a shame we don't have time to look into this boarding school. It seems the thing followed him from there. It wouldn't be the first time we'd uncover an idiot cabal among the faculty of an educational establishment.”

“St Margaret's,” said William nodding. “Bloody Nora, but I hope it's not like St Margaret's. That were a bad'un.”

“Thinking about it, I don't believe that's what we're dealing with though. When the creature was talking, it seemed more…. more personal than your usual idiot cabal. Do you know what I mean?”

William looked unconvinced, but Julia nodded.

“I know what you mean, Chaptermaster.” she said. She looked down at her notes, a thought that had been nagging at her for some time suddenly crystalising.

“Other brother. Singular.” she said. 

William gave her a quizzical look, but Havelock was nodding his head in agreement.

“Yes, I spotted that too.” Havelock made a sour face. “Is it a clue? Was the thing unaware of Victor because he isn't in the house, or is it something else? Bah! Any number of things could be going on but only one thing is going on. When you start speculating, it's time to stop and go and find some more information.”

 He was quoting his father. It was a sign he was becoming frustrated.

“We'll get nothing more done tonight, I don't think.” he said. “You two might as well get some sleep, if you can. Tomorrow—today really—I want you to do a thorough search of the grounds, Bill, and Miss Garvey—I think it's time you had a chat with Georgie's older brother.”

“Why do I have to take Albert?” she asked. Even as she did so she regretted it, aware of how petulant she sounded even to her own ears. Havelock peered at her a little owlishly, then let out a heavy sigh.

“Because you are an attractive young woman, Miss Garvey,” he said waspishly, “and Albert has been mooning after you since you arrived. He'll almost certainly underestimate you, and let his guard down more than he would with either myself or Bill. You know I'm right.”

She did, but it still made her angry. She stood up, stiff backed. Lord Havelock yawned and knuckled his eyes, opening them wide to try and banish sleep for a little longer.

“I'm sorry, Julia,” he said then, his tone uncharacteristically tired. “I know you don't like him and Lord knows I'd prefer it if people saw you for who you are, but we have to use the tools in front of us. A boy's life is in the balance—maybe more lives than that—and time is short.”

She shrugged.

“I'll see you both in the morning,” she said cooly, and left the two of them sat on the bed together.


### IX. The Grand Tour

 \
Breakfast was a fairly rough-and-ready affair, given Mrs Blaylock had taken to her bed following the previous night's excitement. Once it was clear they were going to have to shift for themselves, William took charge and arranged rashers of bacon, fried eggs, and chunks of only partially-burnt toast. He did so with a cheerfulness that was only a little jarring.

Lady Petherham did not join them. Ambrose prepared a tray and took it up to her room. By the time he returned, looking wan and tired, the others had mostly finished. He leaned against the counter near the back door and poured himself a cup of tea and stood for some moments swirling it in his hands before drinking it with a sigh.

William excused himself, stepping out with a bacon sandwich in one hand, a mug of tea in the other and the obvious intention of enjoying both in the company of a good morning pipe.

Albert arrived late, but ate with gusto. Behind his back, Lord Havelock made unhelpful facial expressions at Julia, raising his eyebrows and jerking his head toward the young man. Julia shot Havelock a frigid glare and then, with a smile she did not feel, mentioned to Albert that she would like to see over the house—if it wasn’t too much trouble. He looked a little taken aback.

“Oh! But I thought I might…” He left the sentence hanging, turning in his chair to look at Lord Havelock.

“No, no,” said Ambrose, flapping one hand vaguely. “I've got things to be getting on with. Books and such like. Give Miss Garvey the Grand Tour, it'll be useful if she knows the lay of the land.”

He smiled insincerely, but Albert appeared convinced.

After breakfast, he showed her around the house itself. They started at the top, in a dark, musty attic, full of old boxes and crates, then the servants' quarters.

“We used to have a lot more staff,” said Albert. “But these days it's just Mr and Mrs Blaylock. With the three of us away most of the time mother says she doesn't need any more.”

Next he showed her the various bedrooms and guest rooms on the floor below. His mother's door was firmly closed and no amount of polite knocking elicited a response. They found Lady Petherham in Georgie's room, reading quietly to her son. The boy was propped up in bed, heavily bandaged. His skin was deathly pale, and he struggled to respond to either Albert's cheerfulness or Julia's questions. Lady Petherham made it clear without saying a word that she wished to be alone with her son, and they quickly said their goodbyes and continued.

When they came out of Georgie's room, Albert was very subdued. He showed her the conservatory, the dining room, the morning room, his mother’s drawing room, and the dust-sheet-haunted ballroom in relative quiet until they approached the door to his late father's study. 

“Mother keeps the study locked at all times,” said Albert.

“That's odd then,” said Julia, pointing to the door which was slightly ajar. Albert looked worried. He cleared his throat loudly, knocked, then pushed the door fully open.

Inside Lord Havelock sat behind the large wooden desk going through a pile of papers. He looked up as they hovered on the threshold, with something of a sheepish expression on his face.

“Nobody is allowed in Father's study!” said Albert, reproachfully. “Does mother know you're in here?”

“She does, don't you worry. She gave me the key herself. I thought there might be some clue as to why young Georgie…” He trailed off with a vague gesture.

“You think this all has something to do with Father?” asked Albert in an odd tone. He began, again, to twiddle with one of his collar buttons.

Interesting, thought Julia. She watched him carefully. He was clearly worried, his general brainless bravado giving way to obvious concern. But what about?

“It's possible,” said Lord Havelock, turning his attention back to the papers. Julia could plainly see the Aletheian Society seal on the dusty document which he was perusing.

“Perhaps we ought to leave Lord Havelock to his investigations,” she said, touching Albert on the arm. He gave her a blank look, then forced a smile.

“Oh, certainly. As long as Mother knows.” He stepped back out into the hall and the Grand Tour resumed—albeit with several nervous glances over his shoulder toward the study door.

“After Father… after the funeral I mean… some dashed peculiar people came and went through Father's study,” he told Julia as they proceeded along the passage toward the library. “I remember mother was very angry. They took some of the books out of the library as well – carted them off in a big trunk. And some of Father's hunting trophies. What do you make of that?”

Julia was suddenly aware of Albert staring at her closely, all suggestion of scatterbrained buffoonery gone and replaced by an unsettling keen expression.

“I'm sure I don't know,” she said in what she hoped was a carefree tone. “How odd!”

“Yes, it was odd,” replied Albert. “Mother flew into one of her rages while they were here, and then cried for days after they were gone. She locked herself away in her room and didn't even come to the station to see us off when we had to go back to school.

He looked a little lost for a moment, and Julia almost felt her heart soften.

“Of course, Father was involved in some dashed peculiar goings-on of his own you know…” he began, as he opened the doors to the library, and tailed off.

William had his jacket draped over a chair and his shirt-sleeves rolled up. He was standing on a stool, carefully measuring one of the floor-to-ceiling bookshelves with a measuring tape. He jotted something down in his notebook with a stub of pencil, and then turned to the pair of them with a broad—and only slightly guilty—smile.

“Just measurin' t'bookshelfs.” he said as if it were the most normal thing in the world. 

“And this will help Georgie?” asked Albert.

William shrugged. “Havelock says it might,” he said. His cheeks flushed as he spoke; he was a poor liar.

“I'm sure if Lord Havelock says it will help, it will help,” said Julia brightly, hating herself.

“Aye, well. I'm done here. Off to take a look at t'cellars next. So if you'll both excuse me…”

William rolled up the measuring tape and slipped it into his pocket, slung his jacket over his shoulder, touched the brim of his bowler, and brushed past them. On his way out he gave Julia what she thought to be a deeply inappropriate wink where Albert could not see.

Her host stared after him, his brow furrowed. She ran her finger over the spines of the books on the nearest shelf, and examined her smudged fingertip. 

Bought by the yard I shouldn't wonder, she mused. I doubt one of them has been cracked since they were shelved. 

“That's the house then,” said Albert. “What would you like to do next? I could show you the cellar perhaps?”

“I'd rather take a look at the grounds,” she said. “It seems to be a nice enough day for a little promenade.”

The gardens were very pleasant, actually. As she had noted on their arrival, they were reasonably well maintained and it was hardly surprising that some of the borders were a little unruly given that the gardener was apparently Mr Blaylock who had a lot on his plate and was not getting any younger. Albert attempted to take her arm but she firmly disentangled herself.

They walked in silence for a few minutes, clockwise, around the house. A little distance away  Julia noticed an outbuilding almost entirely concealed behind a copse of poplar trees.

“What's that?” she asked.

Albert looked in the direction she indicated and ran one hand nervously through his hair.

“That's the old summer house,” he said carefully. “It's off-limits. Forbidden. Mother throws a fit if we go out there. It's quite old and on the verge of collapsing. She calls it a death trap. One of these days a stiff breeze will knock the whole thing into splinters.”

Lying, thought Julia. Interesting.

She did not press the issue. As they proceeded, however, she saw William leaning out of one of the upper storey windows, his pipe in his mouth. He waved, and she and Albert waved back. While her guide was distracted she made significant eye-contact with the doctor and mouthed “summer house” at him. He cocked an eyebrow. She tried again, and this time he got it, nodding. She jerked her head back the way they'd come.

“Is everything all right?” asked Albert, a little bemused. 

 “Yes, of course,” she replied hastily, as above them William knocked out his pipe and disappeared back into the house. “Just a crick in my neck. None of us got much sleep last night.

Albert agreed. “Dashed rum doings,” he said. “What was…”

“You said your father was involved in peculiar affairs himself…” she interrupted as they continued to walk.

“Yes, I did, didn't I? Mother said he and Uncle Edmund did secret work for the Foreign Office. Keeping England safe from its enemies. He was part of some club or something. Do you think she means Father was a spy? Is that a suitable occupation for a gentleman do you think?”

“What kind of club?” she asked, ignoring his question.

“Mother will never say,” countred Albert. “It all sounded dreadfully hush-hush. Very cloak and dagger.”

“It does sound exciting,” said Julia.

“I think perhaps Lord Havelock and Uncle Bill were involved,” said Albert. “In this club I mean. Not that Mother would tell me anything about it. All very secret, this society. Like a… like a…” 

He was trying to find the words – or rather pretending. Trying to draw her out as they walked. 

He knows something, realised Julia suddenly. But what does he know?

“Like a secret society,” he said at last. 

All pretence was gone. He was staring at her intently, now, fiddling with his cufflinks. She turned away from him and leant her face close to one of the flowers, breathing in its heady aroma as she considered what to do next. 

“I think maybe they were in the same club,” she said slowly, looking back at him, interested in how he might react. A triumphant expression passed across his face, although he tried to hide it.

“I knew it,” he said quickly. “Tell me about it…” 

His tone was wheedling. This is not good, thought Julia. Not good at all.

“Do you think that it might have something to do with your brother’s predicament?” she asked.

“It's possible,” he said. “Father brought back all sorts of rum things from abroad. It's possible that one of them might have hurt Georgie.”

“Rum things?”

“Yes. The peculiar men took them away with them after the funeral.”

“All of them?”  

“Yes. All the things Father brought back went into trunks.” Albert folded his arms. He was sweating slightly. Unconsciously, again, his hand came up to fiddle with his collar button.

“Look…” he began. “I know there's something going on here. Mother hasn't spoken to Lord Havelock in years, and now she's invited him back to the house. What does she think he and Uncle Bill can do that a doctor can't? Why not just take Georgie out of the house to somewhere safe? Before something bad happens to him?”

Julia pursed her lips.

“You brother was nearly bitten in half by an invisible shark” she said, a little cruelly. “How much worse do you think it can get?”

He flinched then, looking away and down.

“I just feel so helpless,” he said quietly. She patted his arm.

“If you know something,” she began. “Anything. You have to tell me. He looked at her blankly. “No matter what it is,” she soldiered on. “I… we… won't laugh at you. No matter how unbelievable it might sound.”

Still nothing.

“The light reveals the truth, after all.” she said as casually as she could, watching him for any reaction to the tradition Aletheian Society greeting.

There was no such reaction. For a moment it looked as if he was going to say something – he opened his mouth – and then he shut it again firmly. The moment passed.

“Shall I show you the rockery?” he said. “It's very fine. Victor and I helped Mr Blaylock put it in last summer.”


### X. To the Summer House

 \
Mrs Blaylock was still indisposed. The three Society members met up in the kitchen for cold cuts and another cup of tea, where they made small talk until Albert excused himself to go and sit with Georgie.

As soon as the boy had left, William turned the them with a grim expression. “I've found something,” he said. “Too hard to explain, you'll need t'see it for yourself.”

“Really?” \
	“No,” he said, deadpan. “It's just that there's a hidden vault under the summerhouse with a load of nasty looking books and trinkets. But you'll still want to come see for yourself so….”

As they left the kitchen, Julia added quietly,“Albert knows something, but I don't know what. At the very least he at last suspects the existence of the Society and that his father was involved. His Uncle too. He's pretty clearly feeling guilty about something. Frankly, I think he's up to his neck in whatever is going on here.” 

“Good, good,” said Havelock, although he did not look pleased. “I think once we've looked at what William has found we need to sit young Master Petherham down and have a proper chat with him.”

“He said that some people came and took a number of his father's things away after the funeral,” said Julia. “I assume that was the Society?”

Havelock nodded. “Standard practice. Lady Petherham had made it quite clear that none of the boys would be following Edmund into the Society, so the Leeds chapter sent some auditors over to clear the place out of anything incriminating or dangerous. Not that they will have found much – Eddie was not really one for mementos.”He grimaced, humourlessly.“Not that they did a particularly thorough job as near as I can tell,” he said. “I found a stash of letters with some extremely sensitive contents in a metal box up the chimney. Honestly. Given the situation with Peter, I am very surprised they weren't more careful.”

Peter again. Julia considered asking—again – what was so special about Peter Petherham, but she refused to give Havelock the satisfaction of another one of his mysterious non-answers, so held her tongue. She imagined the Chaptermaster was a little disappointed.

“I don't really remember this place,” said Havelock after a moment. “I mean, it must have been here but in all the times we'd visited I can't remember ever having seen the inside of it

When they reached it they discovered that the summer house was not, as Albert had described it, about to fall down. It had certainly seen better days—one of the panes of glass was cracked— but otherwise it appeared reasonably well maintained at least from the outside. Inside, the single circular room was dusty, dim, lit only by shafts of light breaking through the dirty windows. 

Nor was it locked— although it looked as if it might have been until very recently. It had clearly been forced. They both looked at William, who shrugged.

“T'were an old door,” he said a little defensively. “And we've not got a lot of time t'waste in getting t'key out of Amelia. After we're done, chapter can pay for a locksmith like as not. Now come along inside and see what I found.”

Inside the summer house was a single empty room, thick with dust. A heavy wooden trapdoor lay open along the eastern side, with William's bag next to it.

“Once I were in it were easy enough t'find t'door,” he said. “There were a pretty obvious trail straight to and from it. In the dust like. There were also a stupid bloody puzzle lock but I couldn't be 'avin' with it so…”

He opened his jacket slightly to reveal the crowbar jutting out of the inside pocket.

“You've been quite the little whirlwind of destruction, Bill.”

William shrugged again.

“There's a wee lad's life on't line Ambrose,” he said. “I'm not in't mood for pissing about with slidey puzzle blocks.”

Beneath the trapdoor were stairs, built out of the wall of the room below. On the third step down, there was a modern oil lamp and a box of matches.

“Have you been down?” asked Havelock. William nodded.

“Aye. Just a quick look to make sure it weren't just a wine cellar or some rubbish. It looks bad, Ambrose.”

“Obviously we’ll need to go down, Should one of us stay upstairs in case someone tries to lock us in?”

“Not much chance of that. When I bust open a trapdoor, it stays bust open.” William sounded proud. “There's no furniture, so they'd need t'drag summat heavy in from outside and if they come up behind us then they'll get a proper walloping.”

The big doctor hefted his crowbar and took a few swings to limber up. Julia opened her valise and calmly removed her little pepperbox pistol, checking it was loaded. Ambrose rolled his eyes at the pair of them but kept his peace. He busied himself lighting the oil lamp and found the reservoir was about half full.

“Are we all ready?

His companions made affirmative noises.

“Then let's begin.”	






### XI. The Hidden Vault

The stairs opened into another nonagonal room directly below the summer house. Thirteen shallow stairs lead down to a smooth stone floor. It was cold down here, and as Havelock played the light from the oil lamp across the room it set ominous shadows dancing. There were more oil lamps hanging from brackets, but they were unlit. 

While the summer house proper had been covered in dust, the lower chamber was relatively clean. There was an unpleasant mustiness to the air, like old vegetables. Where the upper chamber had been empty, the lower room was cluttered with furniture and peculiar objects.

There was a work-bench of sorts— more a desk with a leather-backed chair. A lectern. A book-case—not built into the wall but standing by itself near the desk. Along the walls were two rows of wooden shelves affixed to the stone walls which they ran around the entirety of the chamber except for the quarter with the stairs. 

The shelves themselves were covered in objects. Some were small, no larger than a pillbox. Others were quite large; an archaic looking spear made entirely of some black metal lay on a wooden rack along the shelf above the desk.

“Oh my,” said Lord Havelock, a note of awe in his voice. “Did everyone bring their gloves?

Wordlessly, Julia removed a pair of knitted black wooden gloves from her valise and slipped them on. At the same time, William tugged on a pair of thick leather gauntlets, flexing his fingers a little stiffly. Lord Havelock removed a pair of delicate suede gloves from inside his jacket, sliding first one then the other on without looking, his eyes continuing to sweep back and forth across the room.

“Just a precaution,” he said quietly. “I suggest we avoid touching anything until we know what it is. In fact we should be reasonably careful about looking too closely at any of the artifacts as well, at least until we find a catalogue. Remember the Whitechapel vault?”

William nodded, but Julia did not.

“No,” she said testily. “I do not remember the Whitechapel vault. It was before my time. Why would I remember the Whitechapel vault?” 

But neither of the two men answered. They were already moving across the chamber toward the desk and the bookshelf. Julia snapped her teeth together in frustration, and followed after them.

“Oil lamps are half full,” said William thoughtfully. “Fresh oil too I reckon. Someone's been down here. Recent like.”

Lord Havelock cast a careful eye over the desk. There were several stacks of carefully folded paper,  a couple of leather-bound journals, an ink well, and an old school jotter which looked particularly out of place. He picked them up one at a time, flicking through them, and shared a meaningful glance with William who nodded in response.

“I feel like there's something you both know that you are not telling me, and it is beginning to make me quite cross.” said Julia with a mildness she did not feel.

William took his hat off and ran his fingers through his hair, then released a gusty sigh. 

“It's Peter,” he said at last. 

Havelock frowned but didn't try to stop him speaking, focusing his attention now on the bookshelves.

“Sir Edmund's brother?” asked Julia.

“Aye. Peter were t'younger brother. Old Sir Malcolm, he were a friend of Ambrose's da, and a proper high-up member of t'Society. After he passed on, it were expected that Eddie would follow him into the Light, but Peter came along an'all. They were inseparable. Did everything together. Almost everything.”

As William continued his story, leaning against the heavy desk, Julia opened the leatherbound book on the lectern carefully with gloved fingers. She winced at the illustration on the frontispiece, and turned the pages quickly, scanning each in turn. Lord Havelock squatted down and began to go through the books on the lower shelf, muttering under his breath. After he had skimmed each volume, he placed it on top of a growing pile on the ground beside him. 

“The four of us met up at a big cross-chapter meeting in London in t’sixties, and we all got along famously. Edmund left t’Leeds chapter, joined up wi' us, and of course Peter came too. Best part of six years we were together. Busting up cabals, dealing with frights and haunts, disposing of fiends. Same business we're in now, really. They were good times. Mad, but good.”

He stroked his chin, his eyes unfocused, staring off into the past. Lord Havelock, by now going through the books on the middle shelf, took the opportunity to take up the story.

“It was Bill who first started to suspect something was wrong with Peter,” he said. His tone was bland, as if he was merely discussing the weather. “Edmund and I were completely taken in, wouldn't hear a word against him. Made excuses. We had a flaming row about it, but of course Bill was right. The signs were there, we just didn't want to see them.” He grimaced. “None so blind, I suppose.”

William shook his head.

“Don't be so hard on yourselves,” he said. “Peter were a clever man, and a charming one to boot. Clever'n his brother, and clever'n me. It were just luck that I saw him meeting wi' one of t'Rowdy Boys that evening and wondered what were in the package… anyway. Turned out Peter had fallen in wi' a bad lot. A proper conspiracy, inside t'Aletheian Society itself.”

“Conspiracy!” Lord Havelock snorted. He'd stood up and was absently looking though the last shelf of books. “You give it too grand a name. It was barely a conspiracy. It was mostly Peter, and a couple of credulous idiots whose vanity he was exploiting. He was very good at getting what he wanted, was Peter. And it turned out that what he wanted was power, and that he didn't care who he had to tread on to get it.”

“He'd been stealing from t'Society,” said William, shaking his head. “Almost everywhere we went. Mostly stuff that'd not be missed. Books, artifacts, lore. Anything he could get his hands on. And more than once it turned out he was paying folk to get to places ahead of us and steal owt of value afore we got there. Stealing and using. By the time we cottoned on, he'd gathered up quite the collection. Once he knew we were on to him…”

“And how did he find out?” interrupted Havelock bitterly. 

“Peter were his brother.” William said gently. “You can't blame Eddie.”

“I damned well can blame him,” the Chaptermaster snapped in return. He pulled the last book off the bookshelf, paging through it slowly, a complex mixture of frustration, anger, and sadness playing across his features.

“While we were laying a trap to catch him out, Edmund went to see Peter.” Havelock couldn't keep the emotion from his voice, and Julia could hear the pain that betrayal still caused him even now, so many years later. “I think he wanted to give him a chance to surrender, or at least deny the charges. We don't know for sure what happened, but the next thing we knew the both of them were on a steamer out of Dover. We gave chase, caught up with them in Egypt. Peter had used… something… on his brother. Captured his spirit in a jar, turned him into his thrall. There was a fight. They both died.”

“Not just them,” said William.

“No. Not just Peter and Edmund. At the end, it was all down to Edmund, though. We wouldn't have stopped him otherwise. In the excitement it was better to let it be known that they had been lost at sea on the journey back. The Society has all the connections needed for that sort of thing, as you know. It's practically standard practice, and made even easier when there's genuinely not a body. Or worse, a raving lunatic that needs to be transported to Carfax Asylum. There were questions of course, but in the end most people accepted our version of events.”

He sighed heavily, and slammed the book he had been perusing down on the desk. “Not Amelia though. She knew something had gone wrong. I should probably have told her the truth —she guessed a lot of it I think—but she was all too happy to blame the Society for their deaths. To blame me.”

William put one big hand gently on Havelock's arm, and looked as if he might say something, but the Chaptermaster shook him off, turning his attention to the desk. Julia saw the hurt expression flash across the big doctor's face before he shrugged and moved away slightly to look at the objects on one of the nearby shelves.

“What was Peter doing?” asked Julia. She'd been quiet while the two men spoke; this was all news to her. She'd known that something had happened but even the Tribune didn't know the whole story.

William might have answered but Havelock interrupted.

“I am confident it has no bearing on the current situation,” he said a little primly. “I think that's enough family history. The point is that Peter was collecting dangerous things and sorcerous lore, and storing them in caches of his own design, patterned after the Society vaults. We found the one in Whitechapel, and the half-built one in Cairo. It looks like there was one we missed. And not just us. I shall be having some pretty choice words with the Leeds Chaptermaster about this when we're done here. They should have spotted it. They should have done a more thorough search. We warned them how dangerous Peter was.” 

He was clearly angry—with himself, with the other members of the Society, with a dead man and the dead man’s brother. In the flickering lamp light, the dark circles around his eyes made him look less like a wealthy scholar of the hidden world and more like an animated corpse irritated at being turned out of a comfortable grave. Julia wondered again how long it had been since he last slept.

Havelock shook himself then, closed his eyes and squeezed the bridge of his nose.

“Almost all of these books are in esoteric scripts or dead languages,” he said. “Latin, Greek and Arabic of course. Some Hebrew. Even some Sanskrit. How is your Latin, Miss Garvey?”

“Melior quam Sanscritica,“ she replied absently. “Sed non est bonum modo Gallico meum.”

“We'd best get started then,” he said, clapping his hands together. “There's a lot to work through if we're to find this entity. It's is going to take hours, if not days. And we don't have days.”

“Actually I don't think it's going to take that long,” said Julia. “I've found it already.” She gestured to the book on the lectern. “It's in English.” she said. “A whole series of translations from other books. A modern grimoire. There's even a bookmark, look.”

“Well that was a lot easier than I expected it to be,” said Havelock, moving across to stand next to her and peering over her shoulder. “How bad is it?”

“It's very bad news,” Julia replied. “I've got no way of telling how good these translations are. Several of the incantations in particular look like someone has tried to render the sounds of another language phonetically but without reference to any formal system I'm familiar with. I'd really not advise anyone try anything from this book unless they're in a very safe location with some excellent wards and no next-of-kin to miss them.”

“I meant the entity,” said Havelock patiently.

“I know you did,” she said equally patiently. “I'm just reminding everyone of how disastrous translations of occult works are even when the translator is a professional—on which I would bet good money the writer of this grimoire was certainly not.” She took a deep breath. “Unfortunately, the entity is also very bad news.” 

She skimmed the marked section of the book again, her face falling further as she reached the end.

“It's called the Makara, and it says here it was ancient before Storied Babylon was built upon the banks of the Euphrates but that's just the way sorcerers write. It has dominion over things lost at sea and the secret lore of the abyssal depths. The text can't make up its mind if its a demon or a God, which is not a good sign, but it also not really that uncommon.” 

She paused for a moment, finding her place in the document.

“Sorcerer-priests can call it up by offering it a vessel—spilling the hearts blood of a chosen sacrifice. The Makara then inhabits the sacrifice-vessel and the priests can worship it or question it or get it to raise things out of the ocean or whatever mad scheme they have. It can also be used to bring ruin on your enemies, but that's a reasonably common attribute of this kind of nightmare horror. Someone has helpfully provided an illustration of it as you can see.”

She pointed out the illustration, her gloved finger hovering just above it. Someone with more enthusiasm than skill had drawn a mass of serpentine tentacles, crab-like pincers, and toothy maws surrounding a single glaring eye.

Havelock blanched.

“Hopefully it's just an artists' impression,” he said, without much hope in his voice.

“What about banishing?” William looked very earnest in the dim light from the oil lamps.

“Nothing,” she said. “According to this when they've finished with it they kill the vessel. That drives the Makara back to the abyssal depths to await the end of all things. Which is a cheery thought.”

“There's always a banishing ritual,” said William. “Surely? What kind of idiot would call something up they can't send away again?”

“I think we all know the answer to that question,” said Havelock.






### XII. A Conversation with Albert

“I think we can all agree it's past time we had a little chat.” Lord Havelock smiled pleasantly, but his manner was very cool.

Julia had found Albert in the kitchen, talking with Mr Blaylock. Mrs Blaylock had finally regained her composure sufficiently to begin cooking something for the evening meal. She had given him her best approximation of a winsome smile, and asked if she could perhaps speak to him in the library.

As soon as they had entered, William shut the door and leaned somewhat menacingly against it. Havelock had already seated himself in one of the high backed leather chairs, and indicated for Albert to take the one across from him. Julia had arranged herself on the window seat, allowing her a clear view of the interrogation but ensuring the late afternoon sun was behind her. 

It had all been carefully arranged— from where Albert was sitting, he could only focus his attention on one of them at a time, leaving the other two to observe him and ensuring he felt ill-at-ease and outnumbered.

“I'm always ready for a chat, Uncle Ambrose,” said Albert. He was attempting to appear open and co-operative but was not really a good enough actor to carry it off.

“We found t'vault in t'summer house, lad.” said William quietly. Albert blanched.

“The summer house is out of bounds,” he said weakly. “Mother will be dreadfully put out if you've been poking around in there.”

Havelock calmly withdrew the school jotter from inside his jacket and tossed it onto the low table between them. He leant forward, and tapped the book on the Carlinghouse seal embossed on the cover.

“I think we may wish to skip the preamble where you pretend not to know what we're talking about. We might also wish to hurry through the part where you pretend to be outraged, and go straight to the part where you answer our questions.

Albert looked from one to the other with a defiant expression. Julia expected him to deny everything, in spite of Havelock's admonishment. 

Instead he covered his face in his hands and burst into tears.

William immediately made to move forward, probably to comfort him, but Havelock shook his head sternly. “Tears aren't going to help anyone,” he said severely. “Not you, and certainly not your brother. What were you thinking?”

Albert pulled himself together. He looked embarrassed, shooting a particularly worried glance in Julia's direction. “I wanted…” He stopped, stumbling over his words. Wordlessly Havelock handed him a monogrammed silk handkerchief. Albert dabbed his eyes and blew his nose loudly before handing it back. Julia marked with interest that the Chaptermaster folded the silk square carefully and slipped it into his jacket pocket instead of returning it to his waistcoat.

“I wanted to speak to Father,” he said at last. His voice was small, quiet, unlike anything Julia had heard from him before.

This answer was clearly not what Havelock was expecting, but he quickly covered up his surprise.

“That's no ghost you've called up.” Havelock's voice was cold. “It's a terrible entity of the Outer Dark and there's a very good chance it is going to kill your brother. Tell the truth now.”

“I am telling the truth!” insisted Albert wretchedly, but the Chaptermaster was having none of it. Julia, on the other hand slapped her hand to her forehead as realisation struck her. All eyes turned to her.

“Dominion over things lost in the deeps,” she quoted. “Albert… you thought that included your father. Because he was lost at sea.”

She enunciated that last very clearly, staring at Havelock. He had the good grace not to meet her gaze but it took some of the wind out of his sails.

“Yes,” he said simply. “I thought I could command it to bring Father to me so we… so we could talk. I wanted to ask him about… well— all sorts of things. I'd had a terrible fight with mother, you see, and I thought….”

He tailed off. Havelock covered his face with his hand for a moment.

“You. Stupid. Boy.” he said slowly. “Have you any idea what you've set in motion?”

Albert looked absolutely devastated. It had been easy, Julia considered, to forget that he was practically a child himself. His easy confidence had made him seem older, more mature, but it was clear that it had been a facade. She felt some sympathy for him. More than Lord Havelock did, at least.

“I just… I just…” he tailed off again. He was crying again, quietly this time, his head bowed and his hands in his lap.

“No more excuses,” said Lord Havelock. “Tell me everything.

Albert took a moment to collect his thoughts and without looking up began to speak in a quiet, monotonous voice. “I knew that father was part of some secret thing. That was why he was always disappearing off to places. Mother never said anything. She told us it was because of his work for the government. He never talked about it. Georgie was too young, but Victor said that father was a spy fighting the enemies of the King. Keeping the Empire safe from foreign powers.”

Havelock was watching the boy intently as he spoke, alert for any sign of falsehood. Julia doubted Albert was going to lie to them—he seemed almost relieved to be telling this story at last.

“He said Uncle Peter was a spy as well. So one day when he was visiting, I asked him about it. In this very library in fact. He laughed and told me that in a way they were indeed spies.I was so excited. He told me a few stories, after swearing me to secrecy. Such incredible stories.”

“I can imagine,” said Havelock drily.

Julia could imagine them as well. The little boy in short trousers, wide eyed, mouth agape while the older man wormed his way into the youngster's confidence with lurid tales of demons and desperate night-time altercations with enemies of all humanity.

“I lapped them up. I told Victor later, after father and Uncle Peter had left. He told me they were just stories, and that Uncle Peter had been making them up, but he was wrong. After that, when Uncle Peter visited we'd slip away together and he'd tell me more stories. He started bringing me presents—just for me—from all over the Empire. I kept them in a cigar box behind the loose floorboard under my bed.”

“Did he show you the vault under the summer house?” asked Havelock. Albert nodded.

“The last time he was here, before it all happened. He turned up by himself; I remember mother being very surprised. I'd had terrible chickenpox and was off school recovering, and he just appeared at breakfast one morning. Mother was doing her best to hide it but she was not happy to see him and kept mentioning that father was still in London. She went into town—I forget why—and almost as soon as the carriage was gone Uncle Peter knocked on my door and asked me if I wanted to see something secret.”

He paused then, seemingly uncomfortable, and wiped his hand across his eyes.

“So he showed me the trapdoor, and the vault. He told me it was very old—it dated back to the time of old King Charles he said when the Petherhams had been important people. Lord Walston Petherham had been an alchemist and needed somewhere to work where he wouldn't be disturbed—so he made the vault and then he got himself hanged by the Roundheads and it was forgotten until Uncle Peter found it quite by chance when he was a boy no older than I was.”

Lord Havelock frowned. There was something in the story he didn't like but he kept his peace and did not interrupt.

“He showed me some of the things, and his secret books, and he told me all about the Society that he and father were part of. I was excited. I asked him to take me with him back to London, but he laughed and said I was too young but when I was older Victor and I would carry on the Petherham name and lead the Society and the Empire.

“He said that?” Havelock broke in, leaning forward intently. “Lead the Society and the Empire. Those were his words?”

Albert shrugged helplessly.  “I think so. Something like that anyway. It was a long time ago. He swore me to secrecy again and by the time mother returned from town it was like nothing had happened. I begged Uncle Peter to show me more of his secrets, but we never got the chance. The next day, father turned up from London and there was a blazing row. I could hear them shouting from my room, but I didn't understand what they were fighting about. Next morning Uncle Peter was gone, and shortly after breakfast Father left as well and that was the last time any of us saw him.”

He was on the verge of tears again, his slim frame shaking with emotion. Julia felt guilty, as if she was intruding on something intimate that did not directly concern her. Albert was not quite finished, however.

“After the funeral, I asked Mother about the Society and she got very angry. Told me I was never to mention it again, and that those people had murdered my father. You in particular Uncle Ambrose—I can remember her saying that if you didn't hold the knife yourself you might as well have done so. She said she'd go to the Devil himself before she'd let you take anyone else from her. She was so angry, but she was crying at the same time. I thought she'd gone mad. I thought I'd driven her mad. I felt so bad, I didn't mention it again. I put it out of my mind. For a while.”

“What happened?” prompted Havelock.

“It was school really,” said Albert slowly. “I was at such a loose end. Victor has his work for the foreign office and Georgie tells anyone who will listen that he's going to be a doctor but what did I have? Maybe a commission but then what? Be honest with me, Uncle Ambrose. Can you see me in uniform? Responsible for leading men into battle in the name of Her Majesty?”

Havelock seemed to consider the question then shook his head.

“There's many as could do with a bit of that particular kind of insight,” said William to nobody in particular. Albert didn't seem to hear him. He was talking only to Lord Havelock, as if all that mattered was getting the Chaptermaster to understand.

“I was so lost, and so afraid I was going to let everyone down. I wrote to Victor about it, asking if he knew anything, but he obviously went straight to Mother. He was always a tale-bearer. And so we had a massive row, and she said she'd throw me out of the house if I mentioned the Society again, and I said that I didn't need her help anyway because I was a Petherham and I'd find my father's friends by myself or something stupid like that, and then I stormed out. But we both knew I didn't have the first idea how to find anyone. And then I hit on the idea of Uncle Peter's vault. That there might be something in there.”

Havelock leant back in his chair, his expression unreadable.

“Why the vault?” he asked carefully. “Why not try your father's study?

Julia thought of the letters Havelock had found in the box up the chimney, with the Society seal on them, and wondered what else he'd found that the agents of the Leeds chapterhouse had missed.

“I didn't see the point,” said Albert simply. “I was pretty sure that the people who turned up after the funeral had cleared everything out of there just like they had the library. But I knew they hadn't found the vault. So I waited until after everyone had gone to bed, and I crept out to have a look around.”

He shivered, remembering.

“It was so dark, and I didn't dare light the lamp in case anyone saw me. I had to find the trapdoor by touch and wracked my brains remembering the solution to the puzzle. I was certain Blaylock was going to catch me at any moment. Or the ghost of Uncle Peter. Or worse. I used to have nightmares about old Walston Petherham drifting about in the dark with the noose still round his neck and… anyway.”

“Anyway,” agreed Lord Havelock. “I assume you didn't find what you were looking for.”

Albert shook his head.

“Nothing. I knew Uncle Peter had taken some of the books and things with him when he left, but I'd hoped there'd be something. But there was nothing. He'd warned me not to touch any of the items on the shelves—told me they were dangerous supernatural artifacts or some such but he hadn't warned me to stay away from the books. But they were no help either. I couldn't read any of them. Some were in Latin, others in Greek, and a whole load in languages I couldn't even imagine. All except one.

“Peter's grimoire,” said Havelock. Albert nodded silently.

“It was the only book in English,” he said. “Uncle Peter had mentioned it, how he'd written it himself, but I'd assumed it would have been one of the things he took with him. He'd left it though. I thought there might have been something in there so I read through it and… and that's when I read about it. About the… the Makara.”

At the very moment he spoke the name, a cloud passed over the sun dimming the light in the library. Julia felt cold, suddenly, as cold as she had the previous night. She was struck with the overwhelming impression that there was something directly behind her, something vast and terrible and hungry at which she did not dare to look. From the way William stiffened, eyes widening, she could tell she was not the only one suddenly feeling threatened.

“I think,” said Havelock mildly, “That we should all avoid saying that word for the time being, Albert.”

The young man nodded. He seemed eager to get to the end of his tale, and utterly oblivious to the shadow that had fallen over the library.

“The book said it had dominion over those lost at sea, and Father was lost at sea, so I just put two and two together. I was scared, but Uncle Peter said that magic was actually a lot easier than people thought and that it was only old fools in overly starched collars who pretended it was hard, so as to stop other people getting their hands on real power. He said that magic was in our blood—the Petherham blood—and that one day he'd teach me…”

His voice trailed off as he registered the terrible expression on Havelock's face. For a moment it seemed the Chaptermaster might actually hit Albert, but then he sighed and relaxed a little.

“The dreadful thing is that he wasn’t entirely wrong, I suppose.” he said philosophically. “I think I can guess the rest. You made a list of all the things you needed from the grimoire in the jotter along with the chant copied verbatim from the book.”

Albert nodded. 

“There were some things I didn't understand, and some things I couldn't lay my hands on. I've no idea where I'd get water from the lightless depths of the ocean but I got Blaylock to bring me back a jam jar of water from Scarborough when he visited his sister. I didn't know who Tiamat was, but I was able to find Typhon and Echidna in that Bullfinch book. It didn't have their sigils or anything but they seemed pretty snaky so I… I drew snakes on the places the book said to put the sigils.”

His voice tailed off. Havelock was actually boggling at him.

“Did I do something wrong?” he asked.

“A great deal,” snapped Havelock. “Starting with summoning an ancient pre-Babylonian horror. Specifically though I am trying to work out how you are still alive and sane. Did you not think for one moment that what you were doing was incredibly stupid? Cobbling together jam jars of salt water and… and pictures of snakes! What did you think was going to happen?”

Albert looked away.

“I… I didn't really think about it, Uncle Ambrose.” He seemed very small and lost. “I suppose I didn't really expect anything to happen. It was like a puzzle—trying to work out how to get all the pieces together. Learning the chant. I wasn't really thinking about what would happen. I think I'd convinced myself that all I needed to do was talk to Father and he'd make everything… make sense.”

“So you performed the summoning.” It was a statement not a question.

“Yes. On the night of the full moon like the book said. I gathered all the things together and used chalk and string to make a circle, then poured the salt over it. I drew the snakes on myself with a mirror, which is harder than it looks, and used saucers from the kitchen for the candles. I stole incense from the church. That makes me a thief, I suppose. With a stroke of luck, one of the big trees out toward the village got struck by lightning during the big storm in March and I was able to get a branch to use as my magic wand.”

He tailed off.

“Now I say it out loud it all sounds faintly ridiculous. It didn't work anyway. At least I didn't think it worked.”

“It didn't?” Havelock frowned. Albert spread his hands.

“I didn't think so but now… I suppose it worked it just went wrong somehow.”

Something had been niggling at Julia while Albert had been unburdening himself. “The ritual needs something specific,” she interjected. “Heart's blood. From the sacrifice-vessel. How did you get hold of that?”

She was not sure if she wanted to know the answer, in all honesty, but she had to know. She couldn't imagine Albert as a murderer. Presumably he had found a way around that requirement as he had the others.

“Oh yes, the ritual said it needed heart's blood, but I thought, isn't all blood heart's blood really?

Julia stared at him.

“Whose blood did you use?” asked Havelock carefully. They were all thinking the same thing—that Albert had used Georgie's blood and that was the reason for the current disastrous situation.

But Albert looked taken aback and faintly offended. “Mine of course,” he said. “I wasn't about to drag Mother, or Blaylock, or some random stranger down into the cellar and start cutting them!”

Havelock went very still. “Your own blood?”

In answer Albert unbuttoned his cuff and rolled up his sleeve to reveal a makeshift bandage around his upper arm.

“Damned thing won't stop bleeding though,” he said. “I've had a devil of a time hiding it. The bandage keeps soaking through. I've had to start tearing up bed sheets and blankets.”

William moved quickly across and took Albert's arm carefully, deftly unwinding the cloth. The young man kept talking as the big doctor worked. “Like I said though, I didn't think it worked. The vault became very dark, all the oil lamps flickering and going out, and there was this smell—a stench really—and it got very cold. The lamp I had in the circle with me was the only light. I was absolutely terrified, I don't mind admitting. But that was it. It only lasted a minute or so, and then it just… faded away I suppose. It was enough to tell me I didn't want to be messing with this kind of thing though. I hid the stick in the shed, and washed the snakes off, and smuggled the rest of the things I'd borrowed back into the house, and told myself I'd find another way.”

He had been speaking with growing confidence, and then his face suddenly fell.

“Then mother was called up to Georgie's school, and she brought him back. As near as I can tell the first attack took place almost exactly a month after that night in the vault. I told myself at first it was just a coincidence, that Georgie had just taken ill or that he was faking to get out of school but…”

“But it became harder and harder to ignore what was happening,” concluded Lord Havelock. “And Amelia was wise enough to realise that it was nothing natural that was attacking Georgie. Why did it take her so dashed long to call on us, though?”

Albert sat up straighter, and looked Havelock in the eye for the first time since the interrogation began. His cheeks were a little flushed.

“Mother did the best she could!” he said passionately. “She tried two doctors, and a specialist from York. She even brought a Catholic priest in to do an exorcism. But none of it had any effect. We tried taking Georgie out of the house—to Scarborough in fact—but it made it worse. He got so pale, and he passed out and started having a fit when we got to the station. Nothing worked. Nothing.”

“The warding bag,” said Julia. “That was you.”

“I tried everything I could think of,” he said. “I even went back into the cellar and tried to summoning spell again, but nothing happened. I tried commanding it to leave Georgie alone, but it was useless. I couldn't find any way to get rid of it. I started dropping hints to Mother that we needed help, but I didn't dare mention the Society in case it made her even more stubborn. I was at my wits’ end.”

“And then she called for us,” said Havelock as William carefully rewound the bandage about Albert's arm. “And we came, and you finally had what you wanted. Members of the Aletheian Society under your roof.”

Albert looked shocked, and a little heartbroken at that.

“I didn't want it like this!” he wailed. “I didn't want you coming here because a… a demon… is eating my little brother alive. I'd do anything to take it all back!”

“Anything?” asked Havelock quietly.

“Yes! Anything! How can you think anything else! I never meant for any of this to happen! I never wanted anything bad to happen to poor Georgie! Please, Uncle Ambrose. There must be something you can do!”

Lord Havelock sat quietly for a few moments staring into the middle distance.

“There might be something,” he said slowly. “You're certain that in all your searching in the vault there was nothing about a way to banish the creature once it was summoned?”

Albert shook his head mutely.

“Then I'll need to consult someone who might know how it can be sent away again. As to you, boy, I want you to go and find that stick you used, and any of the other ingredients you can find. Don't tell your mother. I'll want you dressed and ready to move after nightfall. Then you go and wait in your room until I send for you. And if you think of anything else you let me know immediately, do you understand?” 

Albert nodded enthusiastically, and jumped up. His face shone.

“I knew you wouldn't let me down, Uncle Ambrose,” he said with absolute certainty. “I knew as soon as I saw you in the hall that it was going to be all right.”

He rushed out of the room. The others stared after him. It was clear that Havelock, in particular, did not share the young man’s confidence.

“T’cut on his arm is right peculiar.” said William, all business. “He says he made it months back, but it's as fresh as if he did it less than an hour since. If its been bleeding for as long as he says, and at a steady rate, he should be anaemic at the very least and most likely dead. So it's not natural, or he's lying, and I'm given to think he's telling t'truth.” 

“I agree,” said Julia. “But I can't imagine how he managed to conjure anything up with that fool's list of ingredients.

Havelock pursed his lips.

“Well, Peter was right about one thing,” he said after a few moments, slightly absently. “The occult sciences are easier than people imagine them to be. Almost every ritual is laden down with a butcher's bill of symbols, and specifics that it doesn't really need. It seems like, against all the odds, young Albert stripped away all that extraneous rubbish and managed to make the ritual work as much by accident as anything else. But by all rights he should be dead, or mad, or vanished. Instead the thing went after his brother. It makes no sense.”

“What now then?” said Julia. “I don't like to be a prophet of doom, but Georgie's time is running out.

“Now?” said Havelock shaking himself slightly, and rising from the leather chair. “Now it is time for desperate measures.”






### XIII. Desperate Measures

Rather than attend the evening meal, Lord Havelock sent his regrets that he had pressing matters to which to attend. He borrowed Julia's tub of salt, and one of her candles.

“You may as well go to dinner,” he told her as she provided the items from her valise. “But I can't afford to miss the twilight and, as you say, time is of the essence.

“I'll come with you,” she demurred. “I've not got much appetite myself.”

Havelock looked as if he was going to argue, but William stepped in before he could say anything.

“I'm for tea,” he said. “One of us should show their face and I've no stomach for what you've got planned. But you shouldn't be alone. What if summat goes askew? No, Miss Garvey should be there. She's a member of the chapter, and there's been too many secrets, Ambrose. That's what's got us all into this pretty state of affairs in t'first place.”

William rarely put his foot down, but when he did the Chaptermaster did not argue. He might not have been happy about it, but he accepted Julia's company with the best grace he could.

“We'd better get started then,” he said, and left the house though the conservatory heading towards the summer house. Julia hurried to catch up.

“So what is the plan?” she asked once she was confident they were far enough away to be able to speak without risk of being overheard.

“I'm going to try and speak to someone who might be able to help,” Lord Havelock answered.

Julia frowned. Havelock registered her expression.

“Someone dead,” he clarified. “The dead know things. Secret things. They talk to each other, you see. There's not a lot else for them to do as I understand it. It's best not to dwell on the implications of that if you want to sleep at night, believe me.”

“Do you not need… I don't know. Candles, and boards, and special tables and what not?”

“Nothing but distractions to fool the gullible, as my old teacher used to say. The right words, a circle of salt, and a hank of hair is all you need to raise a ghost if you have the Will.”

“He sounds fascinating.”

“She. And she's a monstrous old harridan, and you will be lucky if your path never crosses hers.”

When they reached the summer house, Julia expected them to head down into the vault but Lord Havelock shook his head. “No, we'll do it up here. I don't like the feel of the vault. We'll need a circle—it doesn't need to be too big. Just big enough for the ghost to be bound within.”

With very little ceremony, he picked a spot near the middle and carefully begin to pour out a slightly wobbly ring of salt.

“Is this a good idea?” ventured Julia as he worked. “I'm fairly sure that we have rules about necromancy, Chaptermaster.”

“That is very true, Miss Garvey,” answered Lord Havelock as he slowly shuffled around making sure his line of salt was unbroken. “But, we must not forget that rules come in two very distinct flavours. A great many rules—even the rules of our Society—are stupid, and are basically a very structured form of bullying. Other rules, of course, are sensible, and prevent us doing foolish or wicked things. But all rules—stupid or sensible—are made by men and women like ourselves. They are not built in to the fabric of creation.” 

Julia started to say something, but Lord Havelock continued to talk.

“Please, let me finish. I'm about to do something very foolish and it will help settle my nerves.”

Julia indicated he should continue, wrapping her arms around herself. Despite a gloriously warm summer’s day, as evening gathered in, the summer house was becoming distinctly chilly.

“Where was I? Yes. Rules. In the first place, good rules help stop the kind of people who like following them from doing foolish things, and generally levy penalties on those arrogant enough to assume they are above the concerns of their fellows. That kind of framework is very helpful in the world in general, as well as in a Society such as ours. But in the second and considerably more important place, good rules exist to make us think very carefully before we do something stupid. In the case of the Society, they also provide opportunities for our peers to punish us if we have broken them without very good cause. But no more than that. Anyone who lets a simple rule stop them doing what they know to be right is a coward.”

Julia arched an eyebrow. “That's a very nuanced attitude to rules for a Chaptermaster, if I may say so, Lord Havelock.”

“Yes,” he said. “Isn't it just? But don't forget that I spend my entire life breaking rules, in some cases just by going about my day-to-day existence and doing things that a great many other people take for granted. That kind of thing tends to help one form a nuanced approach to rules in general.”

Julia could hear the bitterness in his voice, then, and knew it had nothing to do with their current situation.

The circle drawn, Havelock clapped his hands together explosively. 

“Enough of that.” he said. “I'm now going to attempt with a circle of salt and a candle what Odysseus needed a trench full of milk, honey, water, wine, and the sacrifice of two sheep to achieve. In the event it goes wrong you should be safe but you know the rules, Miss Garvey.”

“Don't make any bargains,” she quoted. “At least… unless it seems like the right thing to do, maybe?”

Lord Havelock laughed then and a little of the tension went out of the air.

“Quite. But more seriously, keep your wits about you and if it looks as if I am going to do anything stupid, extinguish the candle.”

He pulled a little box out of his pocket then, one she had not seen before. It looked a little like a snuff box. He opened it gingerly; it contained what appeared to be a little bundle of hair. His tongue protruding slightly as he concentrated, he teased three strands free, holding them carefully between finger and thumb. He snapped the box closed again one-handed, and slipped it back into his jacket pocket.

“No time like the present, I suppose,” he muttered under his breath.

With a smooth motion he dropped the three strands of hair into the candle flame and spoke a short phrase in Latin. It echoed unpleasantly in the close confines of the summer house in a way that gave Julia goosebumps

The candle flame surged up, and then shrank almost to nothing. There was a smell of burning hair, and a sound that was neither distant bells, nor tearing cloth, nor whispering but suggested each at the same time. The temperature plummeted; both Havelock's and Julia's breath fogged in the air as if it were the depths of winter.

Between one breath and the next there was suddenly a figure in the circle of salt. A handsome man, a little younger than Lord Havelock, with neat brown hair. He was stripped to his shirt sleeves, which were rolled up to expose muscular forearms. The front of his shirt was scarlet with freshly spilled blood, and one of his braces had snapped. It would have been impossible to mistake him for a normal man, however. His skin was white as snow, and seemingly bottomless black pits gaped where his eyes should have been.

“Ambrose,” said the ghost softly. Its voice was clear, but also distant. It sounded sad.

“Edmund,” replied the Chaptermaster. His voice sounded strained.

“It's summer,” said the spirit, as if that were important.

“Yes,” replied the Chaptermaster. “It's been about three years since we last spoke. I don't have much time, Edmund. I need your help.”

“Please, Havelock,” said the ghost. “You can spare a minute or two? It may have been three years for you but it has been an eternity for me. Is Bill well?”

“He's fine,” said Havelock shortly. “He sends his regards but you know how he feels about… this kind of thing.”

“Good old Bill,” said the ghost. It continued to smile its sad smile. “He never had much patience for this kind of foolishness. He always wanted to remember people the way they were when they were alive. Alive, and warm, and capable of joy.”

“Edmund…”

“I know, Ambrose. I know. You wouldn't do this unless it was very important. That's what makes it so sad. I wish you'd come speak to me more often. It gets lonely, here, with only the dead for company.”

The spirit looked around then, and frowned.

“Where are we, Ambrose?” it asked slowly. “It seems familiar.”

“We're at Petherham House,” said Havelock, as if he had been dreading the question. “In the old summer house.”

“Has Amelia finally forgiven you for killing me?” The ghost smiled but there was no mirth there, only more sadness.

“Not really. But she needs my help. And I need your help.” He took a deep breath and plunged forward. “It's the boys, Edmund. Georgie, Albert, and maybe Victor as well. They're in danger. Real danger. Our kind of danger. And I don't know how to save them. I'm hoping you do.”

Between one blink and the next the ghost was suddenly at the very edge of the salt circle, within arm's reach of Lord Havelock. It did not reach out; its arms were folded. Its expression was stern.

“You were supposed to keep them safe,” it said. “You promised me. As my blood was pumping out of me, you promised me you'd keep them safe. You both did.”

“I'm not going to make excuses,” said Havelock. “I'm here now, and it may not be too late. I need your wisdom, Edmund. Georgie is in immediate danger – there may only be a few hours left. We think it's something to do with Peter.”

A ripple went through the spirit, and for a moment Julia could see straight through it. The room became noticeably darker.

“Speak to me,” said the ghost.

“It's something called the Makara,” said Lord Havelock. “It has its claws into Georgie and unless we can find a way to banish it—and banish it tonight—then I don't think we can save him.”

The ghost said nothing. It simply stood there staring at the Chaptermaster with its empty eye sockets.

“How is this to do with Peter?” it asked at last.

“It's a creature from one of Peter's books,” said Havelock as quickly as he could. “There was another vault, one we'd missed. Albert was trying to find the Society and accidentally summoned it up and now it's attacking Georgie. We don't have time for a more detailed explanation.”

“Albert…” said the ghost. “It would be Albert, wouldn't it?”

Its tone was thoughtful, introspective, as if it was talking to itself.

“I worried about Albert,” said the spirit slowly. “Peter was too friendly with him. At first it seemed harmless enough but… Even before… what happened it started to worry me. Amelia didn't like it. She sensed something was wrong. I tried to ignore it, but…”

It tailed off. Havelock narrowed his eyes.

“Albert told us the last time Peter was here, you came suddenly and there was an argument?

“A fight more like,” said the ghost. “Amelia summoned me from London, beside herself. She was worried that Peter was going to try and take Albert away with him. I came as quickly as I could. We fought. I told Peter I didn't want him coming to the house when I wasn't there, and that I didn't want him filling Albert's head with nightmares. I told him some of what Bill had said, and it made him furious. I think… I think that was the point I realised something was very wrong. That my brother had designs on his nephew that were not altogether wholesome.” 

The ghost leaned forward, flickering between solid and ethereal. Its expression was earnest.

“I took precautions, though,”it said suddenly. “I made sure whatever else happened, Albert would be safe. I wasn't worried about Victor—he had no time for his uncle. I wasn't worried about Georgie—Peter barely knew he existed—but I knew Albert needed my protection.”

“What did you do?”

“I gave him my amulet,” said the ghost, miming removing something from round its neck. “Our father's amulet. Old Walston's masterwork, that he gave to his youngest son before the Roundheads hanged the bastard. Handed down from father to son for more than two hundred years.”

Havelock looked confused.

“You never mentioned an amulet, not in all the time I knew you.

“Nobody knew. Not even Peter. It was a secret, you see. Part of the tradition.”

“What does it do? I assume it does something.”

The spirit did not answer straight away.

“It protects the wearer from outside influence.” it said at last, flatly. “Old Walston was terrified of losing control of his mind, of his spirit. It gives the wearer the certainty of freedom, that they will always be their own man. That's what Father told me when he gave it to me. Be your own man, he said. And don't ever take the medallion off because if you do you'll go the way of old Walston.”

Realisation hit Havelock.

“And you gave it to Albert, and then Peter was finally able to bring you over to his side. That's why you betrayed us.”

The ghost shook its head.

“No, Havelock,” it said gently. “I've told you before. I went to Peter because he was my brother and I loved him, and because I was sure that he would listen to me. But yes, you are right in a way. When it was clear I wasn't going to join him willingly, Peter used his jar on me, and made me go with him. If I'd had Walston's amulet… but I didn't. For the first time since I joined the Society, I didn't have it. And then I died. Just like Old Walston, and like father, and like everyone who wore the amulet between us.”

“Protection from outside influence,” interjected Julia excitedly. “The Makara is meant to inhabit the vessel provided by the summoner, but the amulet meant it couldn't take possession even if Albert wanted it to.”

The ghost's head whipped round, focusing its attention on her as she spoke. She felt a surge of dread.

“Who's this, Havelock?” it asked.

“A colleague, Edmund, one you don't know. Here in case I decide to do anything stupid.”

“Like let me rest in peace at last?” There was a terrible bitterness in the ghost’s voice.

“The Makara,” said Havelock. “The candle is nearly done. Tell me about the Makara.”

“And if I do, Ambrose?” said the ghost sadly. “You'll send me back into the dark again as soon as you get what you wanted. Just as you always do.”

It turned toward Julia, its tone wheedling.

“Please, miss. If there is any mercy in you, release me from the hell in which my good friend has trapped me. He calls me out of the dark to answer questions, then sends me back as soon as I've told him what I know, to wait the next summoning.”

“Edmund,” said Lord Havelock, a little threateningly. “Don't.”

The spirit ignored him. “Please, young woman. There is no justice here, only torment.”

Havelock raised his hand and in a clear voice said: “Edmund Peterham, shade, I command you to speak. Tell me what the dead know of the Makara, of its nature, and of how it may be banished from the earth. Sic ego nunc praecipiam tibi!”

The spirit of Edmund Petherham recoiled from Havelock as if it had been physically struck, clutched its head in its hands, and let out a stifled wail of pain. Julia grabbed the Chaptermaster's arm, but he shook her loose. “Not one word, Miss Garvey. Not one more word until this is over.” 

He turned his attention back to the ghost. “Please, Edmund ,” he said in a more normal tone. “I have to know. Georgie is still alive, and you are not, and when all is said and done I will make you give me what I need because if I don't a little boy is going to be eaten by a demon.”

The ghost slowly lowered its hands. It stood still, its face turned towards Lord Havelock. There was no anger in its voice when it spoke, only a deep sadness that made tears prick in Julia's eyes.

“The Makara is bound to its own rules,” it said slowly. “It has been called and it cannot depart until it has claimed its sacrifice. In the old days, the wise sorcerer would bind the beast close, and dispatch it as soon as the task for which it has been raised has been completed. Those who were tempted to keep it long enough for it to become angry and break its bonds brought destruction down upon their heads.”

“How is it able to attack Georgie?” asked Havelock. Sweat was running down his face. Clearly commanding the ghost was taking its toll.

“Through the bonds of blood. The red salt sea that runs in the veins of one runs in the veins of all their kin. Thus did foolish sorcerers bring down disaster on themselves by choosing a sacrifice too closely aligned to their own lineage, and then keep the Makara bound long enough that it could trace its way back to them and blast their line.

“How do we banish it and save the boy?”  

“There is a rite of banishing. It needs only the wand that was used to raise the beast, and a spoken command from the sorcerer.”

“I need to know the details. Damn you Edmund, this is your son!”

The ghost was silent for a long moment and when it spoke again its voice was more natural. “Oh, Ambrose. The news is not good, my friend.  The banishing rite can only be performed only the New Moon, the symbolic time when the tides are at their lowest. And it means the death of the one the beast is haunting.”

Havelock's shoulders slumped.

“There's no other way?” 

“None.” the ghosts voice swelled with compassion. “I wish it were otherwise, Ambrose, I really do. But this thing brings only sorrow.”

Silence, then, for a long minute.

“I'm sorry,” said the ghost. “I know it’s not much consolation, but I will do my best to find the boy's shade when it gets here. Help him understand. Help him adjust. It won't be easy but at least he won't be alone.”

Havelock set his face.

“I'm not going to let Georgie die,” he said firmly. He straightened up. The candle was flickering madly, nearly burnt down to a spreading pool of wax. The spirit was watching it carefully, waiting for something.

“There's no point watching the candle, Edmund,” said Havelock. “I'm not going to make that mistake twice.”

The ghost nodded sadly. It seemed resigned.

“How many more times must we do this, Havelock?” it asked quietly. “How many more times are we going to do this to each other?”

“Not many more, Edmund.” said the Chaptermaster sadly. “Not too many more. Goodbye, my friend.”

He leaned down and pinched the wick of the candle extinguishing it. By the time he'd straightened up, the ghost of Edmund Petherham was gone.

### XIV. A Walk At Twilight

“You think I'm cruel,” said Lord Havelock suddenly, as they walked back toward the main house. The sun had almost entirely set and the first stars were visible in the eastern sky.

“I never said that,” said Julia.

“You didn't need to say it out loud.”

“I thought Edmund was your friend.”

“He was. And then he died, and I kept some of his hair and sometimes when I think it's the right thing to do I call him up—like I did tonight—and I use him as a conduit to the spirits of the dead. You can learn a lot from the dead. They know a lot of secrets; they're practically everyone who ever existed after all.”

“He didn't seem very pleased to see you.” Julia regretted her tone almost immediately but Havelock just sighed.

“He was at first. It was all very sad. Then he started to resent the fact that I kept calling on him. Using him, I suppose. I never did it lightly, you must believe me. But the dead… they aren't always the same as we remember them being when they were alive. Every time it gets harder and harder to get Edmund to cooperate with me, and harder and harder to send him back into the underworld. I imagine something will go horribly wrong long before I run out of hair.”

He spoke matter of factly, not really looking at Julia.

“You saw how he was,” he said sadly. “I had to keep reminding him his son was in danger, distracting him from his desire to keep me talking until the candle burnt out, or from trying to play on your compassion to get him free of the binding circle.”

They were nearly at the house.

“Bill thinks it's my fault,” he said, shaking his head slightly. “That the more I call him up, the more I wear away at who he was and the more I turn him into a sort of angry spirit, consumed by jealousy  for the living, forgetting who he was and who I am. I worry sometimes that he's right. But… the dead know many secrets.”

He touched her on the arm then, gently.

“Please,” he said. “Don't say anything about what happened to Bill. Let me handle it. I don't want to upset him if I can avoid it.”

He made to open the door but she stopped him.

“Was it worth it?” she asked. “Breaking the rules I mean.”

“I think so,” he replied, perhaps a little too quickly. “I think I know what has to be done at any rate.”






### XV. Preparations for War

Lady Petherham was waiting for them in the conservatory, with William and Albert.

“Well?” she said stiffly. “William won't tell me anything and now my son is keeping things from me too. I assume you have hatched some kind of plan?”

Havelock nodded.

“I think so,” he said.

“Well? What is it?”

“I think it best that you don't know,” he said.

The blood fled from her face, and she clenched her fists so tightly her knuckles went white. 

“You think it best?” she began. “You. Think. It. Best?”

“Amelia,” Havelock tried to mollify her. “Amelia, you must understand. Georgie is being attacked by a demon. If we don't act quickly—act tonight—he is going to be dead by dawn. And I can think of only one way to save him and you are not going to like it!”

“Tell me,” she gritted through clenched teeth. He shook his head, defeated.

“We're going to summon the demon,” he said quietly. “And then banish it. There is a banishing rite but it is extremely dangerous and there is a very good chance someone is going to get badly hurt.”

Julia was about to interrupt and remind him that the banishing rite was not going to work—but there was no chance he had forgotten that. He was simply lying to Lady Petherham.

“You expect me to stand by while you work…. work witchcraft on my Georgie? Stand by and do nothing?”

“Not exactly. I need you and the Blaylocks to be ready for the aftermath. We'll need hot water and warm blankets and medical supplies. We'll need to know you are out of harm's way, so we can stop worrying about you getting hurt and do what needs to be done.”

Lady Petherham tried to argue, but Havelock crossed the distance between them and caught her by the shoulders.

“Amelia, please, listen to me.” he said, his voice throbbing with sincerity. “You sent that telegram because you knew—knew—that we were the only people who had a chance of saving Georgie. You didn't even reach out to the Leeds chapterhouse, you called for us. For me. You have to let me do what I need to do, and if you do then I promise you I can save Georgie.”

She was wavering, uncertain, afraid. Terrified. Desperate.

“And if you don't let me do what I need to do, then I promise you that Georgie will be dead before dawn and the demon will move on to another one of your sons.”

She crumbled, then, leaning against him, eyes clenched shut, leaking tears. He held her awkwardly, grateful to Mrs Blaylock who swept in to take her from him, guiding her out of the conservatory with a venomous look back at Lord Havelock.

As soon as she was out of the room, Havelock whirled round and started handing out assignments. His manner was completely changed; he seemed to burn with passionate intensity. Julia had seen him in this state before—it meant he had made up his mind about the best course of action and just expected other people to fall into line with his intentions.

“William!” He jabbed one finger towards the doctor. “I need Georgie in that bath chair, wrapped up warm, and at least vaguely compos mentis, and I need it within the hour. I need you to have your medical bag and be ready for whatever happens.

The big man sketched a mock salute, and hurried out. They could hear him pounding up the stairs two at a time.

“Mister Blaylock!” The burly man was already on his feet following after his wife. He jumped slightly, and looked worried, but touched his forelock anyway. “I need you to find as much lamp oil as you can. We're going to need plenty of light to work with. I also need you to find some weapons, and then stand guard over your wife and Lady Petherham until we're done. Do you understand?”

He nodded quickly, and fled the room. Lord Havelock had already dismissed him and turned toward Julia.

“Miss Garvey!” He jabbed his finger towards her in her turn. In spite of herself, she stood slightly to attention. “We're going to need two protective circles. One big one, and one medium sized one. I want them in the vault.”

“It wasn't very effective last time,” she began, but Havelock cut her off.

“You know as well as I do that it's easier to ward against something when you know what you're dealing with. You've got Peter's grimoire, and an entire room full of dangerous supernatural artifacts to play with. Make it work.”

She was full of misgivings, but grabbed her valise and headed for the door nonetheless.

“As for you, Albert,” she heard Lord Havelock saying as the conservatory door closed behind her, “I want you to show me your father's medallion and explain to me why you never mentioned it before.”






### XVI. Gathering

In the end it took the better part of two hours to get everyone and everything into position. Getting Georgie down the stairs was a challenge all his own—William would have struggled by himself but Albert was eager to help. 

Georgie sat in the old-fashioned wicker-and-steel contraption bundled up with a heavy jumper over his pyjamas and with a thick woolen blanket tucked tight over his legs. He gazed around wide-eyed at everything, clearly excited to be awake so late and in such unfamiliar circumstances.It was obvious how poorly he was doing, however. The only colour to him was in his cheeks, red like two berries in a snow drift.

The vault was lit by four oil lamps, each turned up as bright as they would go, with a fifth on Peter's desk. Julia had her candle—what remained of it—ready as well. She'd finished her warding circles—rings of white chalk painstakingly drawn out to make them as precise as she could manage, with silver coins and iron nails at various points. She'd eschewed salt following the experience of the previous night and had added as many protective symbols as she could work into the design. Some were copied from Peter's illustrated grimoire, while others were familiar from Society documents, allegedly effective against creatures of the Outer Dark. 

Havelock nodded approvingly then paused as his gaze fell on some additional elements that seemed out of place.

“What are these squiggles?” he asked.

Julia glared at him defiantly. “Mongooses” she said.

He blinked at her. 

“Make it work, you said.” explained Julia frostily. “Albert said the summoning involved drawing snakes, so I've drawn mongooses. Which are very basically stretched ferrets, known for their hatred of snakes.”

She took a deep breath, and shot a quick glance to where Albert and William were lifting Georgie's bath chair into the larger of the two circles. The Chaptermaster realised suddenly she was on the verge of tears, and was at a loss as to how to respond.

“I'm sure the circles will be very effective,” he said, a little clumsily.

“I'm glad one of us is,” she whispered harshly. “The last one didn't even slow the creature down. I doubt these are going to do anything at all, and Georgie is going to….”

She tailed off.

“Did you find anything useful among the artifacts?” asked Havelock. She shook her head.

“Nothing I was prepared to risk. There's no index, and without knowing what these things are, playing about with them is a recipe for disaster and explosions.”

The Chaptermaster could not fault her. It was unlikely Peter had kept these things for sentimental value—much more likely they each possessed their own provenance. Experimenting with an unknown supernatural artifact was not to be undertaken lightly and certainly not in circumstances as fraught as these. Not if you liked having two arms and legs and being able to speak in sentences.

“What is the plan?” asked Julia, still speaking in a whisper. Havelock looked away.

“We're going to try and banish the thing,” he said slowly. “And if that doesn't work, I'm going to try the final two lines of the Saamaa ritual.”

Julia looked at him incredulously. She grabbed his arm.

“Has that ever worked?” she hissed urgently. “Ever? Have you even heard of it working?”

“Do you have a better idea? If you can think of something else we can try, then I am very much all ears.”

She considered for a moment.“We could shoot it,” she said finally. Havelock stared at her with a similar degree of incredulity as Julia had shown him a moment before

They stared at each other.

“Perhaps the banishing will work,” she said at last. “Even without the right moon. Albert is the summoner after all. As well as the vessel.”

“Perhaps it will,” said Havelock.

Neither sounded very convinced. Havelock gave Julia what was clearly intended to be a reassuring smile, and then straightened up and started to rearrange people. William and Julia joined Georgie in the larger circle, while Havelock guided Albert to the other chalk ring. The young man was looked extremely worried, clutching the length of blackened wood he called his “wand” for dear life.

The Chaptermaster put his hands on Albert's shoulders and searched his face as he asked: “Are you sure you are prepared to do this, Albert? To make it right?”

Albert swallowed hard, but he nodded his head quickly.

“Anything,” he said, his voice shaking a little.

“Then I want you to call the Makara.”


### XVII . The Ritual of Banishment

His hand trembling, Albert raised the lightning-struck branch. He glanced across at Georgie, and then at Havelock who stood behind him. The Chaptermaster gave him a tight-lipped smile of encouragement.

Albert took a shivering breath and then, in a quavering voice, began to intone the words of the summoning.  

“Ma-Ka-Ra! Ta-Ba-Na-Ka! Ma-Ka-Ra! Pa-Na! Da-Na!” 

They sounded like nonsense syllables, but at the same time they made Julia's skin crawl. At her side, William rested his hand on Georgie's shoulder and made reassuring noises, but he could not keep the concern from his face. The youngest Petherham boy whimpered slightly, low in his throat, but did not speak.

After only a few moments, the light from the lamps began to dim perceptibly, although the flames themselves were not diminished. Shadows oozed from beneath the stairs, spreading like black treacle across the walls, floor and ceiling. It became deathly cold, and Julia again experienced that feeling of heaviness that heralded the imminent appearance of the Makara.

“It's coming!” she cried out, somewhat unnecessarily. As her breath misted in the air, the darkness beneath the stairs spread to cover the entire wall. Again, there was that sensation of gazing out into utter blackness, and the hint of something immense just on the edge of sight. She remembered the illustration in Peter's grimoire, and immediately wished she had not.

“This didn't happen last time!” said Albert, halting his chant. 

“Be brave, Albert!” said Havelock. “Be brave!”

With a low hiss, a figure oozed out of the darkness into the vault. This time it made little pretence of humanity. Covered head to toe with delicate silver scales with sharp fins extending from its forearms and its back, its eyes were wells of liquid darkness. As it stepped into the steady light of Julia's candle, it snarled, revealing a mouthful not of teeth but of whipping, oscillating tendrils.

Albert cried out in shock, but Georgie was silent, merely staring at the abomination. It held out one hand toward him and, mesmerised, he half rose from the bath-chair. William pushed him back down.

“No you don't, lad,” he whispered hoarsely. “Let it come to you—if it dares.”

The thing laughed, terrible hissing laughter.

“If it daresssss?” it mocked. “If it daressss?”

It glided forward another pace or two into the room proper, and Julia was more convinced than before that what they were looking at was nothing more than an extrusion of the cyclopean horror that lurked beyond the darkness that had swallowed up half of the vault already.

“Now,” said Havelock, his voice surprisingly calm. “Now, Albert. You raised it, you can send it back to the depths. Command it.”

The entity turned its head toward the Chaptermaster as he spoke, and narrowed its unnatural eyes.

“Sssss. Who isss here?” it asked, almost to itself.

It turned its head from one side to another, but it seemed unaware of Albert. The amulet, thought Julia. It can't even see him properly!

“No matter,” it said, with more confidence. “We shall not be denied!”

Albert seemed paralysed. Havelock shook him. 

“Say the words,” he said urgently. “Tell it to leave! Before it reaches Georgie or all this has been for nothing! Do it!”

Stumbling over the words, Albert raised his stick and spoke in a trembling voice.

“Go… go back where you came. I called you and now I am… now I send you back! Go back!”

The Makara paused. It tilted its head, as if listening. Then it resumed moving toward Georgie, Julia, and William.

Albert tried again but again the thing ignored him. Julia pulled out her pepperbox pistol, levelled it at the Makara, and shot it repeatedly. The retort of the pistol was deafening in the confined space, but it did not even give the creature pause.

From the other circle, she heard Havelock shout something indistinct. The Makara—or its protrusion at least—paused and looked toward the Chaptermaster. It was less than half a dozen paces from Georgie.

“Sssssssaaamaaa?” it scoffed. “Really?”

It laughed, and its laughter was unspeakable. Julia and William clapped their hands over their ears, and Georgie let out a low moan, his head lolling onto his chest. Even the Chaptermaster took a step back, grimacing. Only Albert was unaffected.

Havelock looked quickly between the creature, Georgie, and Albert. His face was torn with indecision—but then suddenly it hardened with resolve.

“Albert?” he said, grabbing the young man by the shoulder. “I think I can save Georgie but you must do exactly what I say, do you understand?”

Albert nodded, unable to tear his eyes from the Makara.

“Give me your father's amulet.”

Albert half turned, his face crumpled with incomprehension.

“Trust me,” said Havelock. “It's the only way!”

“Quickly!” shouted William. He and Julia moved round to stand in front of Georgie. Julia was reloading her weapon and William had his cosh, but there was little chance they would prove any more than momentary impediments to the creature. 

For its part, the Makara's pawn was almost at the circle of chalk. It had paused, briefly, to stare down at the squiggled mongoose Julia had drawn on the floor. Its expression was alien and unreadable, but it was clear that it would not be distracted for long.

With numb fingers, Albert lifted the medallion from round his neck and held it out. Havelock grabbed it, and for a moment it seemed that Albert was not going to let go of the chain. Then he opened his fist and let it slide through his fingers.

“Bill!” shouted the Chaptermaster. “Here! Quickly! For Georgie!”

With the smooth overarm movement of a life-long cricketer, Havelock hurled the amulet across the vault. It moved sluggishly through the thickened air, and for a moment it looked like he had misjudged the trajectory. William caught it, fumbled it, dropped his cudgel and just managed to keep hold of the chain from which the silver medallion hung. 

As soon as he had it, he spun round and looped the medallion over the boy's head.

Julia levelled her pistol at the Makara again but suddenly it had lost interest in them. It turned its inhuman visage, slowly, to where Havelock and Albert were standing. 

“I'm sorry, Albert,” said Havelock. “I'm so sorry.”

The young man clearly didn't understand what was happening. But Julia did.

“What have you done!” she shouted.

Havelock didn't answer. He stepped smartly to the side and with one foot scuffed the edge of the chalk circle surrounding himself and Albert, rubbing it out.

The Makara moved immediately. Gone was the slow, threatening advance. It swept across the vault, clawed fingers outstretched, its feet barely touching the ground. The entire chamber echoed with the roaring sound of the surf, and suddenly it was in front of Albert.It sniffed the air, and a long black tongue unrolled from its mouth.

“The vesssssel!” it hissed triumphantly.

Albert had a moment to turn is head to look at Havelock—one look of utter betrayal—and then with an echoing roar, the Makara embraced him. It wrapped its unnaturally boneless arms around him, pulling him close, then seemed to flow around him, engulfing him, as if he were falling into water. He couldn't even scream.

It was over in an instant; where before there had been the young man and the horror, now there was only one.

“Albert…?” asked Julia tentatively.

But no. It was not Albert. Not any more.

“The vessssel,” it hissed, its voice an awful amalgam of Albert's and that of the Makara. ”And no sssummoner to command usss.”

It smiled, the corners of its mouth tearing slightly and sending blood trickling down its chin. Where Albert's eyes were a watery blue, these were reflective pools of inky blackness like those of a shark. Havelock tried to grab it, but the thing sent him flying with a casual sweep of its arm.

Then it turned towards Julia, Georgie, and William, and raised one hand. The fingers flexed and deformed, becoming long razor-thin talons of bone. It took one step towards the three of them, face twisting and distorting.

“You shall be our firsssst sssacrifices in sssuch a long time,” it snarled. “But not our lasssst.”

Tears streaming down her face, Julia raised her pistol.

“I don't think so,” she said. She shot the thing that had been Albert in the chest. The blood that sprayed was all too human. The vessel staggered, one taloned hand going to the wound. Clearly it had never encountered bullets before.

Then it howled in pain, a terrible shriek that shattered every piece of glass in the vault—and by the sounds of it the summer house above as well—as an iron spearhead burst through the vessel's chest. It tugged at the metal ineffectually with its talons, and then Havelock was pushing as hard as he could, sending the vessel staggering back across the vault.

The creature's shriek had shattered the oil lamps, sending slow spatters of burning oil over the books and the desk. Immediately, the dry wood and paper caught light.

“William,” bellowed Havelock as the flames leapt up and raced across the shelves. “I can’t take it alone!”

The Yorkshireman spared a quick glance at Julia and Georgie—she nodded quickly and stepped in front of the unconscious boy—and then threw himself bodily at the figure that had once been Albert.

The vessel—shot and stabbed though it was—possessed preternatural vitality. It swept one of its claws around, just missing with a blow that would surely have disemboweled the big doctor had it connected. Surprisingly agile for such a large man, William dodged to the side and with a mighty shove sent the vessel sprawling back toward the inky blackness beneath the stairs.

The thing that had been Albert Petherham teetered for a moment on the threshold, then in slow-motion fell backwards into the darkness.

Havelock was helping Bill up, so it was only Julia looking at the dark abyss as it began to close. Only Julia who saw, horribly, unspeakably, the immense red eye in the depths staring straight at them. She couldn't breathe or move, and for one terrible moment she thought that they had failed, that the Makara was going to force itself bodily into the vault – not a puppet or an extrusion but the actual leviathan creature itself, furious beyond comprehension—

thirsting for vengeance against the little mortals that had denied it its sport…


### 


### XVIII. Fire and Tears

… but then it was gone. Everything was suddenly moving again. Light poured back in—firelight, Julia realised. The desk and the book case were already consumed in flame, hungrily sweeping across the dry wood of the shelves and devouring the artifacts that Peter Petherham had so painstakingly collected.

Suddenly William was next to her, scooping Georgie up with one arm. With his other, he shook her, breaking the paralysis that had settled over her.

“We have to move!” he shouted. But she did not need telling twice. She ran for the stairs, scrambling up them followed quickly by the big doctor and his precious prize. 

The wooden floor of the summerhouse was already smouldering as they ran across it, crunching through the shards of glass created when the Makara's shriek had shattered the windows. Then they were outside in the cold night air, beneath the half moon and the clear skies.

Lady Petherham was running across the lawn towards them in her night dress, her dressing gown flapping behind her. Blaylock and Mrs Blaylock followed close behind, one with a lamp and the other with a shotgun. Flames were leaping into the sky now, a column of black smoke blotting out the stars. Lady Petherham reached William, and practically tore Georgie from his arms. The boy was unconscious, but already colour was returning to him. He was breathing easily, and while his eyes fluttered beneath their lids, there was no suggestion he was having a nightmare.

She spotted the amulet almost immediately.

“Edmund's medallion….” she asked. Her eyes were read with tears as they sought out Havelock.

“Yes,” he said, clutching his side. “And if you love the boy you must make sure he never removes it. If he does… well. It's likely to go badly for him.”

“Where did you…?” she began and then her voice faltered. She looked past Havelock, and then at Julia and William, her face a mask of fear and terrible understanding.

“Albert?” she said, as Mrs Blaylock claimed the sleeping Georgie from her. “Where's Albert?” 

But her face said she already knew the answer. 

“Without his help, we'd never have defeated the demon!” said Havelock desperately, moving forward. “Amelia, listen to me! Albert is gone, it's too late!”

“Albert!” shouted Lady Petherham. “Albert!”

She made to run towards the summer house. Havelock grabbed her and spun her round to face him. She slapped him hard across the face. Before she could strike him again he grabbed her wrist.

“It's too late!” he shouted. “Too late and Georgie needs you! You have responsibilities, woman!”

She shrieked incoherently, pulling away from him. He let her go. She took two stumbling steps toward the burning building then collapsed to her knees.

“Get out of my sight, murderer,” she said coldly before burying her face in her hands, her body racked with sobs.




### XIX. A Frank Exchange of Views

“Was there no other way?” asked Julia.

Havelock shook his head. Lady Petherham and the Blaylocks had returned to the house, to get Georgie into his bed. The three Society members stood on the lawn and watched the summer house burn. They would get no sleep tonight, and first thing in the morning Mister Blaylock would take them down to the station. 

“Georgie wouldn't have survived until the next new moon. He'd have been lucky to live out the night.” said Havelock. He sounded exhausted. “And what if he did live? You heard Edmund. Even if he'd survived to the next new moon, the banishing rite itself would have killed him. And if we'd let the Makara take him? It wouldn’t have stopped. After Georgie it would have moved on to Amelia.”

“We had Peter's entire library,” she said hotly. “We might have been…”

“Might?” snapped Havelock. “What use is might? Georgie was on the edge, clinging on with his fingertips. And what in God's name makes you think that Amelia would have fared better? A grieving mother who has lost her child on top of everything else? Do you think she would have had the strength to resist the thing? And then what? The beast leaps to India! To Victor! What chance would we have of getting to him in time do you think?”

“We could have tried!” Julia threw her words at the Chaptermaster.

“If in doubt, we save the innocent,” Havelock barked back. “Albert made his choice. What choice did Georgie have in all this?”

“Yes, Albert made his choice,” Julia was striving to keep from shouting. “But there was no malice in him. He wanted his father. He wanted to know about the Society. About us. His intentions were good!”

“Good intentions?” said Havelock, his voice suddenly low, barely audible. “I don't doubt it Miss Garvey. The world is full of people with good intentions. And mostly the amount of harm they can do is limited, and perhaps they even do some good.”

He leant toward her, and his eyes blazed. He spat his words as if the taste of them was bitter in his mouth.

“But sometimes they get hold of something—high office, or a sorcerous rite, or command of an army. And in those rare circumstances the damage that the well intentioned can do all too often eclipses that caused by the selfish and the corrupt a thousandfold.”

“The boy wanted his father! Is that hard for you to understand?”

Havelock's face twisted. Julia felt fear for the first time, fear for the man in front of her.

“Oh I understand it all too well,” he hissed. “We're none of us immune to loss, but what has happened stays happened no matter how much we may wish it otherwise. It has to!”

William laid his hand on Havelock's shoulder. “Ambrose, stop.” he said gently. “Enough.”

The Chaptermaster struck William's hand away.

“This is why we hide these things away, or destroy them where we can. Because if we once start down that road, if we once give in to that temptation to use what we know to make things right then we are all doomed. All of us. You, me, Georgie, Albert, his mother. All of us. If we once fail to be in the right place at the right time, everything ends. Do you understand? What can it profit us to save one life if we condemn millions of others to an eternity of suffering thereby?”

William grabbed Havelock's shoulder again, more emphatically.

“Enough, Ambrose,” he repeated, his voice thick with emotion. This time the Chaptermaster heard him. He reached up, placed his hand on William's, and drew a shuddering breath.

“I would have given anything to have been able to save them both,” he said, broken at last. He squeezed his eyes shut, but tears leaked out nonetheless. 

“I know, love,” said William, pulling Havelock close. “I know.” 

William looked at Julia over Ambrose's head as the Chaptermaster sobbed into his chest, his own eyes welling with sorrow. But he was a doctor, and a soldier, and all too accustomed to death. He held out his free hand toward her, but she shook her head, still angry. But she kept her peace. She had tears enough of her own to shed. 

They stood like that for a few moments, the two men clinging to each other, Julia to one side with her arms crossed, as the summer house collapsed in on itself in a storm of embers, and black smoke, and loss.






### XX. Departure

William lay full-length along his side of the carriage again, snoozing with his hat over his eyes. Havelock sat by the window staring out at the Yorkshire scenery. Julia had given up on knitting, and was reading the Illustrated Police News. It was absolutely shocking.

“They say a man in Hatfield killed and ate three of his neighbours, and tried to eat a policeman.” she said.

Havelock continued to stare out of the window at the rainswept fields.

“I suppose you're going to be including all this in your next letter to the Tribune,” he said.

Julia read a little further while she considered her reply. She had been silent for the entire carriage journey from Petherham Hall, silent as they had stood on the station, silent as they had boarded the train. She had been thinking, carefully, about what to do next.

She'd considered leaving. It was clear that Havelock still didn't entirely trust her. There were simply too many secrets between them. He hadn't shared his plan with her—had sent her away to create wards while he spoke to Albert. He had lied to her about what was going to happen. He'd clearly known that the amulet was the only thing keeping the Makara at bay, and that just as it could protect Georgie it would leave Albert vulnerable. He had allowed the creature to claim its vessel, and allowed them to send it back to the lightless abyss by destroying that vessel. Lady Petherham was not wrong when she called him a murderer.

What would she have done differently, she wondered, if he had taken her into his confidence? If he'd explained that if the banishing failed, and the Saamaa ritual (which never worked) failed, and bullets failed? Would she have been any happier if he had made her complicit in deceiving Albert, made her any more of an accomplice in his death? 

“Yes,” she said at last. “I will be telling the Tribune everything. That young man's heroism must not go unremarked.”

The Chaptermaster looked at her sharply.

“What?”

“Albert. People need to know how he gave his life to save his brother from a demon, most likely related to the treacherous practices of Peter Petheram. On the other hand, Albert's bravery is a clear demonstration that the Petherham line is still of value to the Society. Once the Tribune hears about what happened at the Hall, I imagine she'll send people of her own to speak to Amelia about whatever may be left in Peter's vault. We can't afford to leave dangerous supernatural artifacts lying around willy-nilly, and the Leeds Chapter's negligence appears to have resulted in the death of a young man who could have been an asset to the Aletheian Society. Not to mention that something they overlooked very nearly unleashed a pre-Babylonian horror onto the Yorkshire moors.”

They sat in silence for a few more minutes.

“Thank you, Miss Garvey,” said Havelock quietly.

She snorted.

“Don't.” she said. “I still think you're an arrogant arse who keeps secrets for the sake of it. But you're the Chaptermaster, I suppose.”

He didn't respond, but looked away uncomfortably. She steeled her resolve.

“There's one more thing.” She'd been considering this carefully and had made up her mind. “I'll be recommending that the Tribune send someone in authority to speak to Lady Petherham. Because once he's of age, I'll be recommending that George Petherham be offered a place in the Aletheian Society.”

Havelock stared at her, but said nothing.

“The boy was attacked by a supernatural entity,” she explained in what she hoped was a reasonable tone of voice, “and was in its clutches for several weeks. He knows what really happened in the summer house. Eventually, he's going to go looking for the truth about his brother and his father. We can't afford to leave him on his own. There are a lot of terrible things in the dark just waiting for someone like Georgie.”

Havelock sighed heavily. He clearly didn't like it but her logic was irrefutable.

“May the Light reveal the Truth,” he said.

“Quite,” said Julia.
