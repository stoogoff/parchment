“What are you doing?”

The voice tears through my head like a machine. The grinding of millstones and the harsh retort of the loom. I picture the speaker sitting in the corner of the room. A dark and dirty suit, threadbare, knees and elbows jutting out at sharp angles. His face is hidden by the shadows, the light of the small candle and the smouldering fire not bold enough to reveal it.

“You seek to trick me?”

I stand from the bed, the weight of his gaze upon me. It is a burden, an oppression to be borne as I take two steps across the room to the dresser. I open a drawer and stare inside. I stare back, reflected in the bitter-bright blade, eyes flashing red as the candle flickers and sputters.

“You think you can control me, Mary?”

His voice flares and cracks like the flame. He stands suddenly, his movement an avalanche rushing towards me. Enveloping. Inevitable. I feel him behind me.

But, of course, he’s not there. 

It. 

It’s not there. Whatever it is, it’s here, its hand on my chest. Inside me.

***

After losing Davies during the binding ritual in the Sygun Copper Mines I returned to the Chapterhouse in Aberystwyth to continue my studies. I had hoped to find solace there amongst the books, cocooned within untold centuries of knowledge and the thrice-charmed walls of the House. Yet even with Professor Jones to watch over me and my fellow associates in the Society I did not feel safe.

I was scared and damnably listless. I could not focus, my mind ever wandering to thoughts of Davies and his ultimate fate. Was he truly dead? Or had I abandoned his immortal soul to torment and suffering, bound forever within a box?

They ate at me, these thoughts. Devoured me, minute by minute, hour by hour. If Davies was suffering then so was I, chewed up and spat out by my own concern. If he was at peace, then surely I would be at peace also?

***

_Scenes of my childhood arise before my gaze,_ I sing, my voice wavering. I feel the beast smirk behind me, its slavering contempt tangible in the room.

_Bringing recollections of bygone happy days._ 

I will strength to my voice; to no avail.

I unbutton my blouse slowly and carefully. I focus entirely on the sensation of my fingers as they pinch and move the buttons through the fabric. The blouse falls from my shoulders and I gather it in my arms before folding it neatly and place it on the chair between the dresser and the fireplace. I don’t want to get blood on my clothing.

_When down in the meadow in childhood I would roam._

I reach behind me to pull at the laces of my skirt and I chuckle. It is foolish to think I might see tomorrow, harmed or otherwise, but still I act as if it is a certainty, preserving my few treasures for another day.

“Stop your games.”

Its thoughts press down upon mine, extinguishing my humour. I watch the flicker of the candle flame and let my skirt fall to the floor. I pick it up and fold it. Feeling the coarse material under my hands centres me, helps me to focus. My clothing is so rough since I left the embrace of the Society. I place it on the chair on top of my blouse.

“I am hungry.”

Its voice cracks, sharp and hard inside my head.

I am resolute.

It cannot feed again. I can no longer be party to its appetites.

“We must leave. Now.”

_No one’s left to cheer me now within that good old home,_ I sing, my voice stronger.

***

It took time, both to find the keys and charms to unlock the vault and to work up the courage to go there.

I climbed my way up the seemingly endless spiral staircase, reciting the invocation of opening over and over in my mind, lest the whiskey of courage, warm within me, might dull my thoughts. The vault hidden under the Aberystwyth Chapterhouse is protected by curious magicks—to reach its depths one must climb _up_ the stairs. That was an  unsettling proposition in itself which, briefly, took my mind off the purpose of my journey.

At the top of the stairs I drew a few deep breaths and recovered my composure. The climb had been long and my bag of tools heavy. My little _ignus fatuus_, my only source of light, was dim in the vastness of the outer chamber. It shone, cold and blue, illuminating the path before me, and cast deep shadows beyond the statues of past Society members which stood to attention along the walls.

The door was ahead of me, a stone slab, rough and dark next to the precise limestone blocks of the walls. I walked towards it, every light step echoing back to me in that empty chamber.

I stood before it and spoke the words, my voice barely a whisper. The rock changed, grinding against itself to form a hole in the centre, no bigger than my smallest finger. I drew the key from my toolbag and weighed it in my hand. It was cold and heavy, made of gold, or something similar, greasy to the touch. It fitted snugly in the keyhole and I turned it with a sharp click.

The dark slab ground against itself again, louder this time. It shaped itself to form a doorway and I passed through into the vault beyond.

***

_Only a violet I plucked when but a girl,_ I sing, as I pick up the knife from the drawer.

I shiver. Dirty and naked I stand in this cold little room. I rest the blade against my throat, my hand steady while the rest of me trembles.

“I must feed on something.”

The voice grinds in my mind. I feel the tug of the blade against the skin of my neck, its edge hungry for my blood.

_And oft’ times when I’m sad at heart,_ I sing as I—yes_, I!_—I move the knife down to rest on my forearm._

_This flow'r has given me joy._

I carve. The blade digs into my flesh just above the florid scar, the intricate pattern that circles my arm, repeated across my body, an obscene motif dedicated to the thing inside me. Pain flares. My hand wavers.

“You will not do this.”

_But while life does remain, in memoriam I’ll retain..._

I grit my teeth. The blade bites, blood pours down my arm. The flesh, the meat, falls back. It slaps wetly against my hand before falling to the floor.

“Mary, you are not strong enough to do this.”

_This small violet I plucked from mother’s grave._

***

The vault beneath the Aberystwyth Chapterhouse is huge, its collection of Dangerous Supernatural Artefacts ordered for ease of retrieval and study. Its ordering, however, is not entirely as neat as proclaimed and it took me some time to find the box, two rows across from where it was supposed to be stored.

I pulled on the thick rubber gloves I had brought with me—a necessity when handling artefacts—and dragged the box down from the shelf and placed it on the floor. I sat next to it, my skirts rustling as I made myself comfortable.

It was a small thing; a foot by half a foot and two inches tall. The box was centuries old, made of a strong wood from an unknown tree, stained red with the blood of a people long forgotten, reinforced with cold iron bindings and a solid lock. The last time I touched it was to carry it, alone from the mines, and I had not paid much attention to its workmanship. This time, I noticed the faint scoring repeated across the wood; small flowers, carved in red. Ancient symbols of protection, likely the source of the box’s power.

I placed my hand on the lid of the box. I have no great talent for magick and could not feel the presence of Davies or of the demon we had set out to capture within it.

I took a swig from the whiskey bottle in my toolbag to fortify myself, and a second, just to be sure, before rummaging to find the chalk and paper somewhere in the bottom. I took my time drawing the circle of protection around the box, copying them from a page stolen from the _Liber Juratus Honorii_ I had found in the Chapterhouse library. Everything had to be precise. The intricate symbols, each delicate and perfect, sat before me, sketched in white chalk on the stone floor.

Such variation in the symbols! Some were as letters but twisted or turned, others like the flowers on the box, still others difficult to look at and much harder to draw as their form wavered under the chalk.

When my work was complete I stood and held the box in one hand. The invocation would be impossible to perform with the protection of the rubber gloves. Bare skin was needed to open the box. I removed one glove with my teeth and let it fall to the floor, touched the lock with two fingers and uttered the words of opening. It clicked and slid from the clasp, falling to the floor with a dull clunk.

I pulled open the clasp and raised the lid.

The demon, the beast, the unnamed thing which Davies and I had bound into the box came forth like a tempest, thunder rolling and lightning cracking. I was crushed to my hands and knees from the force of it, the pressure so great a drop of my blood fell from my nose to the stone.

In the storm of the beast, its rage at its captivity a sickness within the weak confines of my ritual circle, I heard a voice. An endless scream. The voice of Davies.

***

“You make a cut, I make a cut.”

I scream as it moves my hand and drags it down my face. My hand. The hand with the knife. Blood wells up and drips, a slow ooze over my chin and down my neck. It is not deep. The cut is not as deep as it might have been.

It is bluffing.

Or so I hope.

I grit my teeth and pace the small room. I know the places where I must stand. I drop to one knee and examine the mark on my calf: a red-purple cut which never quite healed. A symbol with no name outside of arcane ritual or sacred geometry. It is a shallow scar and I should not have to slice too deeply to remove the mark from my body. I grit my teeth, s. Saw away the flesh, mh. My grasp of the knife firm, despite the sweat and the blood.

When the task is complete I stagger to my feet. The lump of meat sits in a red pool, the mark face up.

Just where I need it to be.

***

The presence of the beast bore down on me. The last time I confronted it I had Davies with me. This time all I can hear are his screams. The ritual I had prepared splits the two joined souls, separates one from the other, no matter the power of their binding. I saw not what was physically there, but not in terms of what was there, rather  within my mind’s eye. The beast, a great horned thing, indistinct and towering. Within its shadowy form I could see a white light: Davies’ soul. Or spirit. Whatever is left once the body is gone.

I chanted the words of the ritual over and over, forcing the thing away from Davies. Blood trailed from my ears and my eyes felt ready to burst. After time immemorial Davies stood before me, silent, with tears in his eyes. He gave me a frown and a sad smile, before he faded into death.

The laughter of the beast was unexpected. It was raw, rasping and filled the cavern of the vault. It spoke to me, though I couldn’t understand the words it used. I watched as it forced— squeezed—its shape over the chalk symbols. One was not quite right. Smudged from when I dropped my glove.

Pressure eased as the beast slid through the cracks. I raged at my own stupidity and carelessness. There would be no coming back from this.

I grabbed a knife from my bag and began to carve the symbols for warding into my arm.

***

I cut at my face, deeper this time. My skin falls away and the red wash of blood is a flood down my neck and chest. I am blinded by the pain and I can no longer tell which cuts I am making and which are made by the beast.

“No client will want you if continue this foolishness.”

I try to sing, to block out its voice, but my throat fills with blood. I cough and retch and spit onto the floor, but it doesn’t matter; I cannot remember the words.

I stagger around the room, barely able to stand. I carve more of my flesh, the keen blade ripping through me, leaving chunks of bloodied meat on the floor as I slowly and painfully, remove the marks of binding I had once carved into my body.

The stench of gore filling the room is its own kind of pressure. My feet stick to the bloodied wood. One piece goes in the smouldering fire, though I know not which part of me burns. The fire flares brightly, feeding on the fat of my flesh. I think that is the last symbol. I hope so. I don’t know if I can make another cut.

***

The Society expelled me, of course. I remember the look on Professor Jones’ face as she made her judgement. They _should_ have imprisoned me in the vault, shackled in iron and bound by ritual, but I fear wiles of the beast worked some deception.

The following weeks were a haze of gluttony and lust as the beast revelled in my physical form. When I was lifted out of the haze I found myself standing over a woman, bloody knife in my hand. She looked up at me, gasping and bubbling, as her last breaths escaped through the slash in her throat.

Sickened, I ran, and three streets away I hurled my guts into a dirty London alley until my throat was sore and rasping.

“That was so much fun. Shall we do it again?” asked the beast from somewhere inside me.

And we did. After the ecstatic joy of Polly, the beast found a renewed taste for death, and, I dare say, I became inured to its atrocities, lost in the whiskey it fed me.

It expanded our work with Annie. Where Polly had been a haphazard cut to the throat and an innocent curiosity as it watched her die; with Annie it dragged her intestines from her body and examined their workings, running them through its—my—our—fingers.

With each victim we learnt something new. We understood more of the workings of the body, the placement of its organs, and their taste. We dined together on liver and kidney, no different a delicacy when harvested from a woman as from an animal.

We became greedy with Long Liz and Kate, taking both in one night. We rested after that, the beast finally sated for a time.

Sleeping.

Dormant within me.

Sober, for the first time in months, I wept at the things it made me do, and the growing pleasure I had taken in them.

It slept.

I planned.

***

The binding circle is complete. Laid out on the floor in my flesh. Bloody lumps of meat covered in arcane symbols, awash with light from the fire. Little violent flowers in purple and red, shadows dancing over them. A semi-circle of carnage around the fireplace.

The beast is no longer bound within me and I have regained control.

Of my body.

Of myself.

I am soaked through with pain, barely able to move. The knife drops to the blood-slick floor with a thud. I follow suit, slumping to my knees. The crack of my exposed bones on the hard wood of the floor is agony. The fire roars and its heat burns me, but it is small compared to the harm I have done myself. The smell of meat cooking is almost pleasant after the slaughter-house stench of blood.

The presence of the beast fills the small circle, towering over me, holding me in place. Its blackened horns touch the ceiling of the small room. Its shadowy form expands to fill the space of the circle. I feel its weight, the burden of it greater than when it was part of me. External. Easier to ignore.

“You have freed me.”

Good. It is surprised. It has no idea why I do this thing, after I struggled so long to bind it in place. To imprison it. To temper its atrocities.

It throws itself against the invisible walls of the arcane circle and stops. Just as it was bound in my body, it is now bound within the space formed by my ruined flesh. It lifts me up, its sharp claws a tattoo of pain where it touches me. Pinpricks of terror in what remains of my flesh.

“What trickery is this?”

A raw and gutteral sound escapes my throat. A laugh, I think. _I name you after your atrocities_, I whisper through the pain.

“Then I will make you one of them.”

It guts me, like it did to Polly and the others. Plunges its shadowy claws through my stomach and pulls my entrails out. Holds me in place as it runs its fingers through my innards, watching them gleam in the bright light of the fire.

My head lolls like a ragdoll’s on my neck. I search about for the knife, the object sacred to the beast in which it must be bound. Before it can be destroyed.

“Looking for something it asks?”

I gasp for breath, unable to respond. I see the place where the knife fell, the line of blood dragged through the circle. It—the beast—_Ripper_—turns my head. Shows me where the sacred knife is, slid across the floor, outside the circle, outside the reach of either of us.

I cannot bind it to a thing I cannot hold. I do not have the strength to leave the circle and take the knife.

If this thing is not bound it will be free to roam and commit further atrocities. The things we have done together will pale beside the future I see if I cannot bind it.

It turns my face to look into the bottomless depths of its eyes, their dark holes absorbing all the brightness from the fire. It reaches inside me. I feel its hand around my heart. Only its magicks keep my life in my body.

It grins, certain of its victory.

With my last breath I speak the words.

_I name thee Ripper and I bind thee to my h—._

Its claws slice across my throat. I do not feel it. I complete the invocation, but only in my mind.

I do not know if it is enough.

I am lifted up and flung back. I land on the bed. Body twisted, broken. Heart ripped from my chest. The fire rages. All is bright. 

My heart burns in the flames and, I hope, Ripper burns with it.

***

_Well I remember my dear old mother’s smile,_

_As she used to greet me when I returned from toil;_

_Always knitting in the old arm chair,_

_Father used to sit and read for all us children there._

_But now all is silent around the good old home,_

_They all have left me in sorrow here to roam;_

_While life does remain, in memoriam I’ll retain,_

_This small violet I plucked from mother's grave._
