The man behind the bar didnae want tae serve me, but I glared at him til he backed doon and planked the drinks in front o me on the thin board that served as a counter, avoiding my eye the whole time. 

I glared my way through the crowd tae set the whiskies doon on the table in front o Red an Mr Lu wi a neat wee thunk an a great big proud grin. Red picked hers up and started sipping it in her usual laconic way. Mr Lu, on the other hand, picked his up a bit gingerly and surveyed it at arm’s length like he wis lookin for fishes in pond water. His other hand wis fastened absently in the back o wee Peggy’s threadbare goonie tae prevent her fae crawlin aff the bench, should she get tired o tryin tae cram her wee foot intae her mooth. 

“It should be recalled that I am most pleased to offer my inadequate residence for meetings as may be convenient,” he said in his usual delicate way. 

His wee hoose had been thrown up ootae the same thin boards as the wan I shared with Peggy tae begin wi, but it wis as snug and lovely inside as you please, wi delicate painted furniture an screens they moved aroon tae make different rooms as they needed them. It had a proper kitchen for cookin built on the back, and a garden wi wee mulberry bushes planted aroon it, like an actual home. Not tae mention goin there meant we could include Xingxi, who wouldnae go oot tae somewhere like this. 

“We’ll have aw the other ones at yours, promise,” I said, no botherin tae lower my voice owermuch against the drunken singin just startin up. “But it’s a tradition, see, tae christen somethin with a drink—like an actual bairn, ye ken?—and I cannae afford a whole bottle o whisky. It’s important.” 

I raised my glass. 

“I call the first official meetin o the Aletheian Society o San Francisco tae order!” 

***

I’m fairly sure this wisnae what my Da intended, when he took us aw on the boat after my Mammy died o the childbed fever. But that’s the way these things go. If life wis simple and predictable, we wouldnae need people like us. 

I wonder if he thought things might be different here in the New World fae the way it is in the teemin cities o the Old. If he did, he wis a bloody fool. Mebbe he wis jist grievin. He and Mammy had been a team, see, in the huntin same as everythin else, and he hudnae known which way wis up since she went. 

But he came home wan night and said he’d been charged wi establishin a Chapter in the New World. There were already Chapters in Boston and New York, o course—good established ones wi proper Chapter Houses an aw, and he wis never too clear on why they thought it wis a better idea to send even a guid Society man all the way fae Glasgow instead o sending out somebody fae wan o them. But it’s aw moot in the end; aff he packed us, himsel and wee Peggy and me, ontae a clipper across the wide Atlantic. 

We wurnae in steerage, at least. I’d have dug my heels in there no matter whit the Society said—everyone knows the weans drop like flies in steerage. But we had a cabin the size o a big cupboard wi a couple o bunks set in the wall. Good thing too—we were aw as sick as dugs for the first four or five days, wi wee Peggy wailing like the Deil himsel the whole time. It wis awful enough in the cupboard; it must’ve been like Hell doon in steerage. The reek that came up fae the lower decks any time they opened the hatch wis enough tae gie me the boke by itsel, even after we’d got oor sea legs. 

After that it wis just long an dull, cooped up in there wi nowhere tae go but roon the deck. Da spent a lot o time starin at his auld journals. He said he wis working if I ever asked him anything, but I watched him mair than once an saw he didnae turn a page for an hour, and the dates were aw from before I was born, when he an Mammy were hunting the country thegither. 

We got aff in New York—finally!—and got ontae another ship that wis no so big tae work doon the coast, and then ontae what they caw a riverboat. Da said we were right lucky it wisnae a wagon train. I’d’ve liked that more, but these wurnae so bad. Loads o fowk fae everywhere goin on and aff. Lots o black folk like the sailors fae home; the ones on the boat reminded me o them a bit, and some o them had the same accents, but as we got further south you saw big gangs working in the fields who didnae look in good nick at _aw. _Some o them were in chains; big lines o men an women, and boys an girls my age as well, all chained thegether an working away under that sun wiout even hats. I asked Da if we could _dae_ anything about it, but he just shrugged and turnt away. He wis staring out at the fields the same way he’d been staring at the waves an his journal pages alike on the big ship again. I didnae like it wan bit. 

I think I’d been expecting San Francisco tae be a bit like New York, though much warmer an maybe a bit smaller. Instead it wis…well, no a city, frankly. It wisnae even much like a toon, really; mair like somebody trying to cast a ritual an summon wan up. It was aw drawn in the dirt; the Main Street was as broad across as Sauchiehall Street an there were gangs o folk beginning tae put doon paving stones on the dirt in some bits, but even there some o the buildings were huddling behind false fronts that made them look twice the size they really were. Beyond that, it went aff intae a big warren o dirt streets that wurnae really much mair than tracks, with hooses that looked tae have been chucked up out o thin boards nailed together and already warping under that blazin sun. 

Da got us wan o those. Hummed an hawed about a room in a better hoose and an office, but ended up saying private wis more important than fancy, no tae mention it made it easier to set up aw the proper protections an make sure nobody meddled wi them. It wis good tae see him actually thinking about the here and noo, being honest wi you. 

Turnt out there _wis_ a need for us and no mistake. Things were tight wi the hoose an that after aw the expenses o travellin, so at least til the Society sent money again, I startit walking out wi wee Peggy selling lunches tae the miners in the mornings—just pieces and soup, maistly, but they went like hot cakes. I hudnae been goin oot a week before I heard tell o this mysterious sickness that wis takin aff men that’d been in specific parts o the mines—startit wi nae more than an odd rash on the neck, they said, but they were gone in a week. More an more o them. I told Da; he got in tae see wan of wan of  the sick men an saw the wee marks on the throat where fangs had gone in. The game wis afoot. 

Soon wee Peggy an I were barely seein him at all. He stopped me goin out wi my wee wagon before the sun wis up; he wis out aw night an no back til after then. Wan o the locals startit coming back tae the hoose a few times wi him; I didnae realise she wis a woman at first. She maistly wore some sort o skin leggings an a long belted shirt, her hair aw braided back in a solid black tail, an tattoos, like a sailor but on her face. She wis aw business; no rude, but no chatty either. It seemed like a good thing fae Da; work as an antidote fae grief and aw that. 

That aw changed the morning the woman came back wi Da slung over her shoulders, still breathing but aw white and cold, wi a thousand o those bites all over his neck an head an face an wrists. She helped me get him intae his bed and even gave me some ointment tae smear on the wounds wi a good solid stink tae it, but none o it did any good. He wis dead by sundoon. 

I found an auld priest in a chapel three streets over tae gie him the last rites. He didnae speak much English, but he didnae need to. He helped me dig a decent grave too in that hard red earth. I found siller tae pay him wi somewhere, though he didnae want tae take it. I wouldnae have the debt weighing Da back here, though. Let him go free tae Mammy, where he’d been in spirit since she went. 

I wis never so glad tae huv wee Peggy as I wis in those few days after Da's death. Since we’d taken her away fae Mrs McGilvray doonstairs, who had fed her alongside her wee laddie, I’d been giving her milk as creamy as I could get it—thanking the Good Lord fae the goats aboard ship, even if it had cost us a pretty penny—wi a drop o porridge on the side. It wis a bit easier tae get here, but it wis still no exactly cheap. I had tae keep makin an sellin soup an pieces tae keep her fed, no tae mention feedin her an washin her an chasin her about stoppin her fae killin hersel—she wis crawling noo, an suddenly everything in the whole world wis the maist interestin thing ye could imagine, even boilin kettles or the ground under horse’s hooves. Nae time tae stare an mope, an even when she wisdriving me near demented, ye couldnae help—I don’t know, _catchin_ a bit o the wonder o the world she saw fae her, somehow. It wis good. Meant I kept my tears fae late at night, an kept them soft enough no tae wake her where she wis curled up beside me. 

As well as keepin me busy, having tae keep sellin pieces meant I couldnae hide fae the fact that the thing, whatever it wis, hudnae been satisfied wi Da's life. The deaths were continuin—worse, they were rampin up. There were notices about Main Street talkin about an epidemic, though they couldnae decide _whit_ of—one day they were sayin typhoid; next it wis scarlet fever. Some folk were walkin about wi rags tied over their mouth an nose even before going doon the mine, as a precaution, but others wurnae sae easy fooled. The word wis beginnin tae get about that it wis a creature—or _creatures_—that wis behind aw the deaths, an wi it the first strains o _panic._ The kind o panic that ends in mass riots an innocents dead by the hundreds, even beyond what the creatures could dae under cover o it. 

I thought about tryin tae speak tae the local lassie who’d been workin wi Da, but I didnae have a clue how tae find her, or even where tae start lookin. I went through his journal an his papers, hoping tae find the sort o comprehensive notes fae the Society reports I wis used tae, mebbe even an address or a map fae where tae find her, but… awI could find wis some scattered notes in a shorthand I could barely even decipher, little more than the things I’d told him in the first place, an a load o sketches o Mammy. Mammy in her armoured overcoat, crossbow in hand; Mammy wi her blouse unbuttoned, unlacing her stays wi her scars just beginnin tae show; Mammy in bed wi her nightgown open, feedin a wean at her breast—mebbe me or mebbe wee Donny, who’d gone suddenly at three o the measles nearly six years ago. 

I pulled the pages out very carefully an pressed them away in the front o the Bible, caught between a sudden aching grief an a growin, furious, impatient anger at Da. He an Mammy had baith drilled me in the _procedures_ fae the Work fae about as long as I could remember. How ye care fae your weapons; how ye research; how ye _note an report,_ sae the knowledge is preserved an safeguarded. How ye _survive._

How had he just let aw o that just…slip, because Mammy was gone? How had he given up aw o that an left me and wee Peggy alone in this sketch o a city, wi _somethin_ I couldnae even put a name tae stalkin the streets, wiout even the knowledge o how tae _fight_ it left behind tae help me? 

I wanted tae scream. I wanted tae break things. But we needed everything we had in that wee bare hut, so instead I sat doon an, following the procedure as I’d been taught, carefully laid out everythin I knew about the attacks. I sketched oot a rough map o the area an the mines an pinpointed the attacks I knew of; I laid oot a timeline; I set doon extrapolations o whit the creature/s size wis, based on the bites, an pit doon whit it definitely _wisnae._ As I laid it oot, the anger drained away intae somethin colder an harder, an more certain. 

After I’d done, I checked wee Peggy wis sound on the bed, then took out the key on the chain I’d taken fae aroon Da's neck before I went fae the priest an unlocked the cabinet where he kept his gear. His armoured longcoat wis hopelessly too big, but I took his gorget—I could make it fit wi a thick scarf padded underneath and another on top. The crossbow an the silver-tipped quarrels went on my back under ma shawl. The paired long knives an the pistol I belted openly enough on my hips. Round here if I wis seen, it being known I wis armed wisnae such a bad thing. 

Before I left, I double and triple-checked the wards, then locked an barred the door fae outside. It wis much safer than bringin Peggy wi me, I repeated tae masel. An oot I went intae the night. 

My eyes adjusted tae the dark an the moonlight wis bright; by the time I got tae the mine entrance, it seemed near as easy tae see as it wis in the daytime. It wouldnae be like that under the ground, but ah telt masel miners had lamps, right? There wid be somethin. Or I’d manage. It wis that simple. 

I touched the Society badge I’d taken fae inside the collar o Da's longcoat and pinned inside the breast o ma jaiket. I wis born an trained fae this. The job had come tae me. 

As I wis takin that moment tae touch the badge an gird masel, the feelin wis hard tae describe. But it wis like the pressure o eyes on my back, and nae hidden ones. I didnae spin aroun. Hands no far fae my pistol, I turnt aroon, slowly an deliberately. 

There wis a wee boy standin watching me, no mair than five or six. I moved my hand away fae my pistol; I wisnae riskin shootin a wean. 

“Hey, wee man. There’s no a night shift here, is there? Are you awfy early fur yer work? Or are ye lost? Ye’re awfy wee tae be oot here on yer own.” 

He didnae reply, but his big blue eyes were lost an forlorn. I couldnae leave this wee soul oot here on his own. I walked towards him, holding a hand oot tae him. 

“Come oan, wee man. I’ll take ye back intae toon an ye can tell me where yer hoose is.”

He looked even smaller an near wobbly wi exhaustion as I reached him. I wis just about tae kneel doon tae scoop him up when I noticed, suddenly, an odd, painful burning against my left breast, just over my heart. I put a hand up tae touch the spot, frownin, and realised it wis the Society badge. It wis glowin, ever so slightly, wi the faintest blueish light, an as I looked doon, still touchin it, I suddenly noticed those big eyes lookin up at me wunae blue after aw. They were yellow, and awfy big for even the skinniest wee boy. An the mooth under them wisnae turned doon wi exhaustion an unshed tears at aw, but grinnin. A much too wide grin wi too many teeth in it.   

There wis the faintest sound behind me, jist the faintest rustle, oot o the darkness o the mine. I tore my eyes away fae the boy tae look over my shoulder. It wis darker than the grave itsel, but I could see glowin points o light in it. Dozens o them, as yellow as those twa eyes before me. 

An then there wis a sudden silken noise back in front o me. My heid shot back round just in time tae see the boy-creature’s slide fae his neck, that horrible, horrible too-wide grin fixed still splittin its face as it hit the ground wi a dull, hollow thump like a ripe turnip.As though he’d materialised oot o the darkness, there wis an auld man standin there, the great shining straight blade in his twa hands stained dark wi blood. 

He wis Chinese, I realised in the moment, though much older than any Chinaman sailor I’d seen at home or on the riverboat, wi a lined narrow face split by an old scar, a great mane o white hair braided back an a long white tail o beard. He wore a belted robe an a long leather vest over it that looked no so unlike my Da's longcoat wiout the sleeves, paintit an tooled wi whit I wis pretty sure were protection symbols, even if if they werenae the same ones as as I knew. From the way he wielded the weapon, ye knew it wis like part o his arm tae him. 

We stared at each other fae the long, long moment before that sickening thump faded away, an then I moved, instinctively, tae cover his left flank, drawin my long knives, as a chitterin sound as horrible as the creature’s grin came oot o the darkness behind me. I jist had time tae brace masel, his bony elbow brushin mine, before the first wave o them were on us. 

I didnae get the best look at them then. Just whit felt like hundreds o wee whip-thin greyish bodies and clawed hands, an those horrible big bright yellow eyes. We fought them, elbow tae elbow, back tae back, an there wis a horrific tang o copper an somethin worse in the air as my knives an his sword took a toll, but in moments it wis obvious we’d bitten aff far more than we could chew, and wi nae more than a glance at each other we were retreatin back, coverin each other’s flanks, kickin an throwin them aff. As soon as we had achieved a tiny breathin space in the narrow bit before the mine entrance we turnt almost as wan an booked it as fast as we could run away towards the lights o the town. 

Half an hour later, I wis sittin on cushions in front o a pig-iron stove inside a wee hoose surroundit by mulberry bushes, built o the same thin boards as mine but otherwise as different as though it had been transported out o a fairy tale. 

I wis sittin across a low table fae the auld man, a cup o tea that smelled like a garden in heaven in front o me. The walls aroon us were either beautiful embroidered hangings or delicately painted paper screens showin fantastic scenes, flower gardens or birds in flight. The older lady in a beautifully embroidered robe who had brought an poured the tea wis carefully paintin aw my cuts an scratches an bruises wi an ointment that smelled almost as good as the tea, though it still had a reassuring medicinal sting tae it after it wis on. She looked as delicate as a butterfly, but as soon as she had opened the door o the wee hoose an raised a single perfect black eyebrow at the sight o me an the auld man on her doorstep, wiout raisin her voice, she’d taken complete charge o the situation, an the auld warrior wis suddenly as docile as a wee lamb in the face o her. She was treatin me first, but the resigned look on his face told me he was expecting tae get the ointment an bandages next and couldnae dae a thing about it. He gingerly raised his wee teacup and took a sip before settin it doon an lookin at me. 

“I admit, company upon my task this night was most unexpected,” he said, “let alone from one so young.” His English was aboot perfect, though the accent meant I had tae think about some o the words fae a minute. “I was unaware there were others of my calling in San Francisco. If I may request forgiveness for the impudence of the question on so short an acquaintance…perhaps I might ask how Fate brought you here?”

His dark eyes regarded me keenly in the lamplight; sharp as his great shining blade, though there wis unexpected kindness in them too. It deepened as I outlined our last six months, how we left Glasgow and came tae Frisco. More than I meant tae tell him when I started; he wis a good listener, that wee auld man, an it wis only when I started talkin that I realised how long it had been since I’d _really_ hud anyone tae talk to. An, despite it breakin strictures, I told him at least the bare bones o the truth about the Society too. I got the feelin it wisnae quite the news tae him I expected it tae be. 

“I see,” he said after I finished, a gentler tone in his voice as he exchanged glances with the lady. 

Or…wis she? I suddenly noticed that, even sitting, she wis taller than the auld man wis; no tall, either o them, but… An her hands, graceful though they were, were bigger than mine, an above careful paint on her lips there were hairs, very very short, as if growin back after bein plucked oot. 

I don’t know if they caught where I was lookin, or jist felt turnaboot wis fair play after everything I’d ended up pourin out, but they glanced at each other, an the auld warrior took her hand in his gently before speakin again.

“Perhaps it would only be fair if I too shared the story of my unworthy journey to this meeting? Ah, yes…” He refilled my teacup an his one-handed, offerin tae the lady and her refusin the same wee nod an raised hand my Mammy an Da used tae use wi each other—twa folk who know each other that well they dinnae really _need_ words. It made sudden tears come intae my eyes that I had tae blink away intae the teacup’s fragrant steam as he began. 

His name wis Lu Zhi, an he wis what they caw an _emo lieshou_ in China. Mr Lu—I did know enough tae know it wis his surname first, at least!—did his best tae explain it, an it came oot as “monster hunter”, or “demon hunter”. 

It had been a family thing for him, apparently. His Mammy and Da—and theirs before them, aw the way back—had been members o the White Lotus Society. I frowned when I heard that name—it wisnae the first time I’d heard it. Something fae wan o Mammy’s society books. He didnae look sae surprised by that either. It…wisnae exactly like oor Society, but…aye. 

Except this wan had ended up bein a focus for a whole rebellion; thousands o folks rising up tae overthrow their Emperor. It had got close, too, apparently, but in the end, it hudnae worked, and havin any connections wi it became a right dangerous thing for anyone wantin tae keep their heid on their shoulders. Mr Lu’s Mammy an Da had been involved, though no near the ringleaders, it sounded like. They escaped the executions an fled away fae near the capital city tae some remote province on the foothills o some great mountains, an that’s where Mr Lu an his brother an sisters had been born an brought up in the family trade. 

Apparently wan of the things their Emperors hudnae approved o about the White Lotus society—it had become this focus for a rebellion that wisnae entirely about its actual business, Mr Lu said, because it wis a proscribed organisation—wis that it allowed women tae get involved on equal terms wi men. That explained why he hudnae gied me the eye about bein a trained fighter, at least. Mr Lu hudnae been a disappointment tae his parents in the monster-huntin, apparently, but he wis nothin special beside his sister Jin Qui. She an her children an grandchildren were still back in his home village, protectin the place, an loved an honoured fur it, he said, just a tad wistful like. But his life had taken him in a different direction. 

It had startit when he wis a couple o years older than me—goin aff tae handle a cursed grove on a trade route tae the next town over the mountains. Nothin too difficult, but it wis his first solo mission, so it took him a wee bit. While he wis there, he ran intae a merchant who told him about mysterious disappearances three villages back in the other direction, so he’d travelled that way wi a caravan an ended up six months there clearin oot some sort o possessin spirit fae the local wolves. And no long after that, he’d heard talk in a tavern about a hoose haunted by a suicide maiden an her fatherless babe that caused everyone who took the hoose tae die o sickness… 

He looked up at me wi a wry wee smile an tilt o his chin under his flowing moustache at that point, and I grinned back. I suddenly felt mair at home in this fairytale wee hoose than I had anywhere since we left the docks at Greenock. 

Some point, he’d been stayin in a tavern where a troupe o actors were performing. The play wis good and he enjoyed it, but the part that blew him away wis the heroine. 

“She sang,” he said softly, “like the bird on the tree of heaven. And her dancing was of such grace it could make any man weep.”

An he kissed the lady’s hand very lightly on the knuckle, his eyes lookin up at hers wi such tenderness I had tae swallow again. Mammy an Da wouldae been like this if they had been able tae grow old thegither. She went as pink as a peony, just as Mammy wouldhae done. 

Afterwards, he had met the heroine in the tavern, dressed noo in men’s clothing. I mustae looked confused, because he went ontae explain that in China women were not allowed tae perform on the stage. Women’s roles were taken by men; usually men who specifically took only women’s roles. The roles were called _dan;_ so were the men who took them who lived largely as women even when they wurnae on stage. Baith o them looked at me; tense.

It took me a minute tae put it aw thegither; it wis awmost as much the sudden tension as anythin else that tipped me aff. It reminded me so much o ma Aunty Sally and her lady friend Agnes. 

I’m still no sure why they telt me on that short an acquaintance. Mebbe if I hudnae poured oot my life the way I had, they wouldnae have. Mebbe if I hudnae been alone in the world but for wee Peggy, they’d have been mair cautious. But here it wis; they’d made themselves that vulnerable tae me. 

I took another sip o my tea an leaned forward.

“So…how did ye baith end up here?” I asked. An jist like that, they baith relaxed. They were sae poised, the pair o them, ye could hardly see it really, but the tension wis suddenly gone fae the room. The older lady leant forward and topped up my teacup.

“I am call Xingxai,” she told me slowly, a little bit haltingly, her voice deep for a woman and high for a man, her smile sae warm it wis like an embrace. 

She obviously understood much mair English than she spoke, because it wis Mr Lu who went on tae explain, a more reserved but jist as encompassing warmth in his voice. 

There were still the occasional upsets an panics aboot the White Lotus, even decades after the rebellion, he telt me. In the remote provinces, it wisnae really an issue, but he followed Xingxai’s troupe, comin an goin as his hunts took him, but aye comin back. An their star rose; they got better and longer engagements closer tae the capital, and he had tae start seriously keepin his head doon. But it wouldnae hae been more than a reason fae caution if Xingxai hudnae caught the eye o a nobleman, who saw her singin an made her an offer tae become her patron. Then wan o his existin favourites, panicking they were gonnae be thrown over in favour o her, decided they were gonnae dig oot every piece o dirt there might be on her, an dug oot that no only did she hae a lover, but that his parents had fled fae the retribution on the White Lotus. an o course they whipped it aw up intae a murderous conspiracy tae get a White Lotus assassin inside the nobleman’s defences. an Mr Lu an Xingxai barely got enough warnin tae flee wi the clothes on their backs. 

“We considered returning to my village,” he said softly, “but we feared bringing the retribution upon my entire family, and with cause. Wherever we went, we found ourselves pursued.” 

After a few years on the run, it became obvious that goin abroad was the only choice. So they took ship.

“I’m sorry,” I found myself sayin, inadequately. They baith smiled, gently squeezing each other’s hands. 

“Do not be,” Mr Lu said gently. “We are all the tools of heaven, in the end. Our destinies await us as they do, and are best greeted with joy.” 

***

It was agreed that I return the next day, and the next, for us tae plan. I brought wee Peggy wi me; baith Mr Lu and Xingxai fell in love wi her on sight. They knew mair about how tae look after her than I did; I wis surprised, at first, but I found oot they baith came fae big families, an acting troupes ayeways had weans aroon. I think they only realised how much they’d missed them when they were chasing Peggy aroon, stoppin her fae destroyin their wee home. Xingxai took to carryin her round the garden wi her strapped on her back; while we planned, Mr Lu whittled her a wooden rattle an wee toy animals, only half o which I even recognised, and didnae seem tae mind when she chewed them or flung them aboot, gigglin aw the while. She wis a much-needed lightness as we dug oot my Da’s journals an piles o delicate Chinese scrolls fae Mr Lu’s painted chests, lookin for clues on how tae fight these things. 

On the third day, there wis a quiet rapping on the slidin door an the local lassie who had brought Da back tae my hoose wis standin there, a bright woven shawl over her shoulders an a basket on her back. She seemed tae know everything we’d been doin an plannin. It seemed impossible she could hae been watchin us wioot bein seen in those bright colours; it wis her own land, mind, an she’d probably forgotten mair aboot it than we’d ever know. 

“Call me Red,” she said laconically as she sat doon cross-legged wi us at the paper-strewn table an startit talkin aboot how tae ward oorselves, oor weapons an oor homes tae protect fae the creatures. She drew Xingxai intae the discussion, which she had seemed a bit tae shy tae really join in before, talkin aboot whit could be done wi herbs an smokes fae her beautifully-tendit garden. I took Peggy hame that night an slept sound for the first time since Da’s death wi the wards supplemented wi hers. 

By another day on, we had a plan.

***

The roof o the tunnel scraped against the bag on my back yet again, remindin me—as if I could forget!—how _close_ the walls were aroon me as I crawled. On top o everythin else, the tunnel floor wis rough an gravelly an my knees were bloody killin me. 

_Ye volunteered fur this, ye utter muppet,_ I reminded masel silently, no wantin tae push the pungent wardin symbols Red had daubed on me that were meant tae make me harder fer the creatures tae detect. _Smallest person fae the smallest passage. Ye complete bloody eejit._

Peggy at least wis safe back wi Xingxai, who wisnae trained fur hand-tae-hand fightin and wis also a bit slow on her feet wi the stiff beginnings o arthritis. I wis terrified enough. I could only imagine addin her tae this situation. 

We did still huv the miners tae worry aboot, though. We wurnae settin aff the charges we were carryin here til after the last shift wis oot, but we couldnae risk bein the only humans underground when we set them in place. Too obvious. Red had done the scoutin and this part wis her idea, but I agreed wi it. Besides, I had tae admit the idea o comin doon here at night gied me even mair o the screaming heebie-jeebies than the size o this passageway already did. 

Finally, I reached the spot Red had drawn oot on the rough map. It opened a little here, though only a _very_ little. But it meant I could take the bag aff my back wioot skinnin my face on the ceilin, and fer that I hudtae be grateful. 

Settin the charges wis simple enough, thank the good Lord. Settin the fuse wis much more nervewrackin. Mr Lu had braided the fuse fur us out o dampened an treated wickin, as just daein it wi a gunpowder trail wis imprecise an stank tae boot, increasing the chance the creatures would realise somethin wis up. It wis still tricky tae set though; makin sure the coils fitted in the space wioot risk o the fire jumpin an takin too long aff the burnin time. The charges hudtae go aff near-simultaneously tae drop aw their infested sections thegtiher. When I had it set as good as it wis ever like tae be, I lit it an began the long crawl back oot.

It wis a long one. Twice, I had tae stop an wait when the sound o the miners got too close. Too many o them who bought my lunches would recognise me. I couldnae afford that when it did aw come doon. Red’s sketchmap o the mine in my heid, I took a couple o the twistier wee passages in the hope o getting oot faster as the main passages filled up wi the last shift leaving fur the night. 

I probably took a wrong turn somewhere. The passages only got narrower an twistier as the sound o the departin shift faded away. I wis crawlin again mair than once, the fear tight in my chest, so it wis with relief that I found an exit shaft I recognised fae the map—a side one, but a straight enough way tae the outside. I went a wee bit faster, nearly trottin upwards—and froze. 

There wis a wee chamber spreading oot before me, packed tae the brim wi the creatures. Coiled up in piles, some o them hanging upside doon like enormous bats between me an the exit.

I could hae wept. My chest tightened like iron jaws clampin round it. I bit my lip an tasted blood, forcin myself tae think. There wisnae a chance o goin round. I’d already taken this long gettin oot. I wusnae so far fae the charges Red would hae set, burnin close tae the wire noo.

There wis nae choice. Red had said no tae push the wards—she’d never encountered these things beforehand personally, and she _thought_ they’d work but wisnae _sure_. So I wis gonnae hae taebe _quiet._ And _careful._

I didnae give masel any mair time tae stew on it. I could feel a scream buildin up in my tight chest, wantin tae escape. I bit on the inside o my cheek, tucked my skirt right up intae my knickers so there was nae chance o a trailin end brushin anywhere I didnae intend it tae—and crept forward. 

My careful, _soft_ footsteps sounded like charges goin aff tae me as my boots touched the floor o the cavern. My gulp o terror an every breath echoed in my ears as I shuffled and crept forward—past this knot o grey limbs here, over this pile o them here. Once, a trailin hem o my shawl brushed a stray clawed foot an wan of the things stirred, and I jist about swallowed my own tongue in horror as I froze, too scared tae breathe. But it settled back doon, and I shuffled on and on, for whit felt like three hundred year. 

And then I made the passageway, and it took aw my willpower tae keep shufflin an creepin the rest o the way oot o earshot rather than bookin it as if aw the Deil’s fiends were after me. I wis quite a sight when I finally joined Red an Mr Lu at the rendezvous point we’d agreed centuries ago at the start o the evening. Even in the moonlight, I wis scraped an filthy. I wis more shocked my hair wis still red an hudnae turned white. Red raised a laconic eyebrow an offered me a flask o some stingo spirit that made my eyes water just tae smell it. I gulped aboot half o it nonetheless. 

None too soon. It couldnae hae been ten minutes after I made the rendezvous that the ground shook, suddenly, an then we were aw three o us lifted aff our feet. The ground shook, and buffeted, an then quite suddenly a chunk o the scrub in front o us jist…caved in. Like it had been punched wi a giant fist. 

We pulled ourselves tae oor feet an retreated further back intae the copse Red had found for us, tae keep watchin as the people turned up without bein seen oorselves. We stayed til near enough the dawn, keeping oor eyes oot fur any o the creatures having survived and comin tae light wi the salvage operations, but there wis nothin, only tons upon tons o broken rock an twisted metal. 

Mr Lu an I headed aff as the sky began tae turn grey. Red nodded farewell wi a crooked grin, an turnt her eyes back tae the rubble. She never wis much fer sayin what she planned til it had awready been done.

I kept an ear oot in the next days, but the idea it had been done apurpose never even seemed to cross folks’ minds. The official enquiry blamed it on an earthquake in the end. Apparently they’re no so uncommon round here.

“An… meetin adjourned!”

I banged my glass lightly doon on the sticky table as I’d seen Da dae aw that time ago. Red wis on her third whisky by then, though it hudnae any visible effect on her. She could put the stuff away in impressive quantities. Mr Lu wis takin tiny, polite sips, an lookin very much like he’d like tae hand the rest o it tae Red. Peggy wis grizzlin an settling fur chewin on wan o Mr Lu’s wooden dogs. Her first tooth wis tryin tae come in. I absently pulled her intae my lap and rubbed a bit o the whisky dregs in my glass ontae her swollen gums. 

Mr Lu quietly got tae his feet.

“If you are ready, perhaps we could return home? Xingxai is making boiled dumplings and will be most displeased if we allow them to become rubbery by our tardiness.” 

He opened his arms tae offer tae take Peggy aff me as I got eagerly tae my feet. Xingxai’s dumplins were no tae be missed. 

He made a polite bow towards Red.

“She has asked me to extend the invitation to you also. I believe she is most interested in your thoughts on her latest tea blend.”

I thought she wis just gonnae blank him at first, as she often did tae direct questions, but she thought fur a moment, then looked up at him, her slight, crooked smile spreading across her face.

“Why not?”

She leaned over and dooned his glass as she got tae her feet, laughing quietly, and I pretended no tae hear his soft sigh o relief as we threaded oor way through the crowd towards the door an the cool night air.
