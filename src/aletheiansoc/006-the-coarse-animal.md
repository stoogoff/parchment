> Balmoral Palace  
> November, 1864

John Brown straightened his glengarry on his head, adjusted his tie and then slowly drew in a lungful of air. He held it for a few moments trying to find an answer to his summoning. Had he overlooked something in his duties? Was he to be made redundant? He pictured his family being ejected from their home on the Queen's estate, and the struggle of those working the land to make ends meet, constantly justifying their worth to their Laird against the potential grazing area of a highly profitable flock of sheep. He shook his head, banishing the gloomy vision from his mind. Quietly he expelled the air from his mouth, squared himself on to the encounter ahead and opened the doors to the drawing room. 

Seated by a coffee table were the old Laird Crathie—a friend of Balmoral Estate—and a middle-aged woman with greying black hair. She wore a simple, dark grey, business-like dress, more suited to riding than to courtly appearances, an ‘equestrienne’ top hat and simple silver cross around her neck. The tailoring of her clothing was exquisite.

The red-faced Laird stood up, wiping his bulbous nose with that ever-present handkerchief. John closed the doors behind him and stood before them, hands behind his back.

“Good to see you, John. The lady here has come to you with a job offer. I’d like you to listen to it.”

The Laird gave a quick bow to the lady and left the room, whispering in John’s ear, 

“Pawns die first, John. Think long and hard aboot this.” as he passed. The lady stood up and cleared her throat.

“Mr. Brown, my name is Cressida Cadwallader. I have been sent here by the The Aletheian Society. The Society investigates occult anomalies and ensures they do not enter into the public sphere. We have found ourselves in a crisis and have seen fit to approach you on a most delicate matter.” 

“I dinnae believe in any hocus-pocus, Mrs. Cadwalla—”

"_Miss_ Cadwallader."

"Oh. Miss… Cadwallader. I think you may hae the wrong man.”

“I do not make mistakes, Mr. Brown. Now, you will be well aware of Prince Albert’s untimely demise to typhoid fever.”

“I am.”

“And his brush with death in a carriage crash the year before.”

“Of course.”

“It is the understanding of The Aletheian Society that it was not disease which killed His Highness. His life was taken by something else.”

“Nonsense, wumman! You shouldny be speaking ill o’ the dead in such a way, especially aboot His Highness. It wis typhoid that took him, nothin’ else—”

“Not so, Mr. Brown, not in the slightest bit in point of fact. It was foul play that took Prince Albert, murder, and by forces beyond most of the population’s ken, but not beyond _our_ contro—” 

“Nonsense!” John flushed with anger. Cressida’s face hardened. “I wullnae listen tae this Spiritualist drivel any longer! It is unfit for the Royal Household. Now gather yer belongings and remove yoursel’ fae these grounds, afore I throw y’oot.”

“Mr. Brown, I have come here—”

“You have ten seconds tae leave this building! Ten. Nine. Eight.” John turned on his heel, marched towards the doors and threw them open, the door knobs striking the walls at the end of their swing. “Seven. Six. Fi—” Cressida sprang to her feet.

“Mr. Brown! Queen Victoria is in mortal danger! She may very well be killed and you, and only you are the single person on this earth that can help her!” John ceased his counting. 

“What?”

“The Queen needs your help, Mr. Brown. She does not know it, and she can never know it, but without your aid, she _will_ die.”

“You threaten the life of Her Majesty!” John stormed towards her from the doorway, removing his glengarry with his fist and towering over her. Cressida raised her eyebrows. Without a trace of a flinch her eyes followed them to meet John's glare head-on.

“That is codswallop, Mr. Brown… and you know it.” His gaze bored into her searching for truth or lies. Her eyes were calm and resolute. They held to his without any shifty signs of madness. They were disciplined and purposeful, and they did not give an inch. “Her Majesty is in danger of suffering a similar fate to that of her husband. The Society does not wish for that to occur. It would be disastrous for these Isles—indeed for the entire British Empire—and that is not something we are willing to countenance. Queen Victoria requires protection, and we intend to grant her ours. Now please, Mr. Brown, if you are quite finished with your theatrics, let us sit down and discuss business.” 

Cressida held his gaze and sat down. She gestured to the chair by the table. John felt his heart begin to slow and calm. Nothing about this woman screamed liar or fantasist. Although the image of her at the head of a seance was not far from his mind, there was an aura to this woman that spoke to a life of discipline and hard work, but moreover an aura of that which inspires trust, maybe even faith—an aura of competence. He sat down and set his mind to listening and understanding.

“The Aletheian Society has an offer for you, Mr. Brown. It is both generous and without chicanery. Should you accept our offer you will forthwith be required to move to Windsor Castle.”

“Windsor?”

> Windsor Castle  
> December, 1864

Queen Victoria finished sealing her letter and handed it to Elsie, one of many servants stood against the walls of her study. Elsie bowed her head and took the letter in both hands. It was the first time the Queen had even acknowledged her existence let alone entrusted her with a Royal Task. She had not the foggiest idea where to take it but the feeling was as thrilling as her first kiss. _One of the other servants would know_, she thought as she hurriedly left the room, closing the double doors behind her. 

Glancing around, Queen Victoria could see the eyes of her court occasionally glancing out of the window before snapping back to looking straight ahead, as all servants should. She followed their furtive glances to the gardens below.

Standing with her pony in hand was an immaculately dressed man, his kilt occasionally blowing in the wind, as did the ribbons of his glengarry. His back straight and head held proudly, the Scotsman’s hard, bearded face was set in stone, staring at the Queen’s study. Staring at her.

“Who is that man?”

“Mr. John Brown, Your Majesty, from Balmoral.”

“Mr. Brown, yes. From Balmoral. Here at Windsor. And what is he doing, standing there?” 

“He has been standing there since breakfast, Your Majesty.”

She examined him for a long moment. Their eyes met. The corners of her mouth raised slightly for a scant moment, then she caught herself, looking around at her servants.

“Tell Mr. Brown that We shall not be riding today, and he can return our pony to the stables. We shall call upon him when he is required.”

 She returned to her desk and sat down. Moments later there was a sharp exchange of words outside, Brown’s broad accent booming across the gardens and seemingly getting the better of the encounter.

Victoria placed a letter in front of her face, blocking the view of her servants. It was from her son Edward, The Prince of Wales. She did not enjoy Bertie’s writing. The very sound of his name made her shudder. _It was all his fault._

She heard the swift patter of footsteps re-entering the study.

“Mr. Brown refuses to return Her Majesty's pony to the stables. He says he awaits Her Majesty’s appearance in the gardens…"

The Queen lowered the letter.

“Oh spit it out, man.” 

The servant, clearly shaken, gulped, his throat dry.

“…in Her Majesty’s riding attire.”

Her face set in consternation she raised the letter in front of her face once more. The edges of Queen Victoria’s mouth rose in a grin and her face softened for a brief moment. It was the first time in months. 

***

“Yes, Windsor.” Cressida stated, seemingly exasperated by the obviousness of her own answer.

“But… but ma whole family is here. Ma wife, ma bairns—”

“And they will go with you, Mr. Brown. All arrangements have been made.” Cressida picked up her purse, put it on her knees and opened it.

“But why? Why dae I have to do this? Couldny any one of her servants dae this job?” John’s irritation was growing. To change your whole life and that of your family? Over afternoon tea? 

“Although the society contains a number of exceptional individuals who are capable of very adequately dealing with this situation, we find ourselves grappling with a problem.”

“And whit problem is that, Miss Cadwallader?”

“Access, Mr. Brown. Our Society has many members in high places, however we do not have access to the Royal household and that is where we must be to protect Her Majesty. The Queen's blood in the wrong hands can lead to an ‘Intersection’, an event so foul it would be as if the very gates of Hell had opened, and our work will have been for nought. And so the Society must contract to an outside party, and your unique relationship with Her Majesty puts you in the precise position to ensure the Queen’s safety.”

Cressida pulled a folded contract from her purse, unfolded it and laid it on the table beside a quill and ink. “And a very lucrative contract it is, Mr. Brown. Three times your current salary. Lodgings and expenses will all be covered by the Society. Even a pension I might add; one greater than you will ever earn in a lifetime of service as a ghillie here at Balmoral. Additionally the agreement grants a generous payment to your family in the event of your grievous injury or death. Your wife and children would want for nothing.” 

“In the event o' ma death? Why wid that be of concern?” 

“Every profession has its dangers, Mr. Brown. Protecting the Queen will most assuredly contain its fair share. That I can promise you.”

There was a break in the clouds and John’s eyes were briefly drawn to a chessboard set up by the window, now illuminated by rare November sunlight. Laird Crathie must have observed this before he spoke, informing or perhaps coining his warning. There was dust on the pieces and the board, clear for all to see. The housemaids would be getting a piece of John’s mind as soon as this meeting was over. 

> Buckingham Palace  
> January, 1865

Edward, Prince of Wales, hated being here. Bertie often envied those of lower status. Their informality and familiarity must lead to close, comfortable ties between family members. Mothers would hug and kiss their sons without affronted looks from those around them. But alas the courtly etiquette of the Royal family must be observed, and today he must formally say goodbye to his Mother before he departed for the Middle East. She was sending him there. She was always sending him places these days, ever since Ireland, ever since Father had passed away. She hated him now, and he knew it. It wasn’t _his_ fault Father decided to come. If he was unfit to travel he should have stayed in England instead of crossing the Irish Sea to tell him off for a bit of rumpy-pumpy with an actress. Heaven knows his predecessors were renowned for it! 

But here he was and he must face Mother’s wrath once more before leaving. Perhaps Her anger would have abated when he returned. _They say absence makes the heart grow fonder_, he thought.

Edward reached the top of the stairs as a hulking great Scot, kilted and bearded, was exiting the drawing room, and he could have sworn he had heard the stifled laughter of his Mother following him.

_Him again. And the man was drunk! Smiling and laughing like this is some sort of common public house!_ Edward locked with the man’s glazed eyes as he closed the door behind him. 

“How _dare_ you—”

“Oh, Your Highness! Great tae see you again! I must apologise but Her Majesty has sent me to inform you that she will not be receiving guests today. She is in some form of malady and is unfit to see anyone.” From behind the closed doors he heard a distinct giggle from the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. 

“Get out of my way.”

Edward made for the door but was bodily blocked by John putting himself between the Prince and the doorknob.

“I’m sorry Your Highness, but I cannot grant you entry. Her Majesty does not wish to be disturbed today.” All sign of drunkenness was gone from the man’s face, and he glowered at the Prince in a clear warning. 

Bertie stepped away. He took several angry breaths, his face set in barely contained rage.

“What is your name again?” As if he could have forgotten.

“Mr. John Brown, Your Highness. The Queen’s Highland Servant.”

The name was seared into his memory. Every _Punch_ reader and gossip merchant in London knew of the Queen’s Highland Servant. 

“_The_ John Brown. Surely not. The ghillie. The Lord Chancellor, Lord Cairns, described _him_ as a 'coarse animal’. Surely that can't mean you.”

“The very same, Your Highness.”

They maintained eye contact for some moments, neither man shifting. 

"I see his point… Jock." The word was spat out. At last Bertie looked away. John straightened putting his hands behind his back. "Tell my mother I shall see her upon my return." Bertie met John's gaze one more time. "Goodbye, you coarse animal. And do not get comfortable. One way or another, Jock, you and I will never meet again."

Bertie turned around. He stalked down the rich, carpeted stairs and began his journey to the Middle East.

John unclenched his fists behind his back. He reached into his pocket, retrieving his hip flask. He unscrewed the top, hands shaking with anger, and raised to the Prince’s back.

"Slainté, Your Highness,” he called, now smiling. He took a deep swig of the whisky within, and then turned on his heel and re-entered the Queen's drawing room.

***

Cressida pushed a book across the table. On top of it lay a fist-sized stone with an eye-shaped hole through its centre. There were what looked like tiny shellfish fossils on its surface and a series of small cracks emanated from the hole.

“Whit the hell is this fir?”

“Mr. Brown, you do have an incredibly long way to go, both in distance and in knowledge. These will aid you in your appointed task. That is an ‘Adder Stone’. When you encounter the Royal Family at Windsor hold this up to your eye, discreetly of course. It will show you what you are up against.”

John made to lift it to his eye.

“Not now, Mr. Brown.” She snatched the stone from his hand and wrapped it in a red silk handkerchief. “When you get to Windsor, I said.”

John’s brow furrowed but he bit his tongue.

“An' this?” he picked up the book.

“That, Mr. Brown, is the _Index Superno_ by Sir Thomas Browne. A very distant relative of yours and a 17<sup>th</sup> century physician to royalty across Europe. It is an encyclopaedic list of supernatural entities that Sir Thomas encountered as he protected his numerous royal charges throughout an illustrious career, and that you may encounter as you protect yours."

“Entities?”

“It details their appearances, behaviours and strategies for defeating them. You should study this cover to cover on your long journey south. And then do so again. And then do so again. This will arm you against any potential perils ahead.”

As Cressida put the wrapped Adder Stone into a drawstring pouch John opened the book and leafed through a few pages —then sharply closed it with a thud. 

“There are demons in this book.”

John’s hand instinctively went to a silver cross he wore around his neck. Cressida saw the action and inclined her head slightly, an action John interpreted as a conciliatory nod.

“Yes, there are, Mr. Brown, you are correct. And all manner of other-worldly wickedness that seek to do harm to those of Royal blood. With God’s help you will defeat them and keep our Queen and Empire safe.”

Cressida put on a pair of glasses and began leafing through the contract.

John placed the book on the table and stood up. He walked over to the chess set by the window, the sun now eclipsed by a dull cloud. Crathie’s words rang in his ears as he picked up one of the dusty pawns and held it up to his eye.

“I am to fight demons?”

“In a manner of speaking, Mr. Brown, yes.”

"And I am to fight them alone?"

"The Society will support you in any capacity it can. Contact the London Chapter via the address listed here and arrangements can be made to advise or aid you. Though let us be clear, we cannot attend the Queen's Court with the frequency with which your own unique relationship grants you, and thus your duty is inevitably a solitary one. We have however provided you with the tools to achieve a successful outcome.”

Cressida moved the contract to one side and pulled a small blue, velvet-covered box from her purse. Opening it she revealed a simple gold ring.

“This will protect its wearer from the worst of these malign forces. It is the only one of its kind, Mr. Brown, so do not misplace it. Put this on the Queen’s finger. Keep it there and your task will be complete.”

John replaced the pawn in its position on the board and picked up a Queen from the black side. He regarded the piece in his hand. The dust adding age to the already funereal colour. 

“How am I supposed to dae that, Miss Cadwallader? The Queen disnae wear the rings of Her servants.”

Cressida shut the box and got to her feet.

"_I can do all this through him who gives me strength._ Philippians 4:13. I do not care by what means you accomplish this task, only that it is accomplished. For if the Queen is not protected, and soon, she will join Prince Albert in the beyond, and these islands will enter a hell of biblical imagining and Luciferic consequence.” Cressida stepped towards John. “I pray I have been as transparent as is required for your commitment to this most urgent duty. The next move, Mr. Brown, is entirely yours.”

John remembered a time with Albert and Victoria in a bothy near the River Dee. Albert full of vim and vigour, Victoria alive with courtly, but very real joy and a simmering admiration for her husband. The love was real, respectable Royal marital bliss. Then he saw her on her last visit to Balmoral. The dress black as coal. The face unsmiling, sullen and pale. Her court devoid of all mirth. A living, breathing funeral without end.

John blew the dust from the chess piece, wiped it clean on his jacket and put the Queen into his pocket. 

He strode over to the table and signed the contract.

> Frogmore  
> September, 1865

John led the Queen on her pony as they arrived at the Royal Mausoleum. He helped Victoria down and she looked up at the grand building. It towered over the them and to John’s eyes the Queen’s proud, defiant manner appeared completely gone, replaced by sadness and vulnerability, as if looking at an opponent she knew she could not defeat.

“I do not bring anyone here, John.” He nodded solemnly. 

“I know, Your Majesty.” John opened the door. Steeling herself the Queen stepped inside.

Their footsteps echoed through the vaulted ceilings and bare stone walls. Hard, unforgiving clatters as they approached the tomb of Prince Albert, the place Victoria would join him in rest. Queen Victoria bowed in front of the tomb and crossed herself. She knelt upon the pew before it, screwed her eyes shut and bowed her head.

John stayed near the entrance, leaving the Queen to her prayers and her grief. This was not good for her spirits, this refusal to say goodbye, but it would not be proper to suggest she do otherwise. The rides around the estate were doing her good, and perhaps her solitary visits to this forbidding place might lessen in frequency. Her seeming wish to join her husband might abate, in time. _It must_.

From his sporran John felt a short pulse. Careful not to make any noise he opened the flap and withdrew the offending item. The Adder Stone let out another brief pulse as he examined it. It was warm to the touch. Raising it to his eye he peered through it, and the chapel now seemed full of gloom. A thin, grey fog occupied every inch of the vaulted space where there had been no fog before. Through the hole in the stone he looked at the tomb of Prince Albert. Perched on the tomb were a great number of dark, leather-winged creatures about the size of children barely away from the breast. They writhed and wrestled with each other in a black mass, their talons and teeth clawed and gnawed at the stone of the tomb. As the Queen let out a short sob they their attention was drawn towards the pew. They began to peel off of the tomb and into the air above Queen Victoria. The flying mass above swarmed and wheeled and finally dived at the kneeling figure. 

John dropped the stone and made for the Queen, but all was as it was before he had put the Adder Stone to his eye. No fog, no winged creatures, just Victoria, Her face turned towards him and a scowl upon it that could sunder a mountain. He bowed his head at the admonishment. She returned to her devotions and began to cough weakly.

John slowly returned the Adder Stone to his eye. The creatures teemed around her as she knelt, trying to bite and claw at her, but at every attempt they were rebuffed and sent sprawling by a bright, white aura coming from the Queen’s body. It was not a constant, it seemed to give way here and there, flickering and fading just long enough to give the creatures opportunities to attack, but reforming just in time to knock them off course, sending them reeling in all directions.

Unable to look away, John watched the scene intently. Under the constant barrage of attacks he noticed an eventual fade in the aura's brightness. The gaps between the aura's shielding grew slightly longer, and the creatures got closer. It would hold for now, perhaps for months. It would not hold forever. 

After yet another fouled attack one of the creatures struck the stone floor in front of John. It shook its head then seemed to notice him peering through the stone. The creature bared its fangs, screeched and flew straight at him.

John snapped the Adder Stone down from his eye and raised his hands in front of him, bracing himself against the expected attack. Upon the calloused pinky of his right hand he wore a simple gold ring.

No attack came. Everything was as it should be. No fog or swarms of creatures, and the Queen continued her quiet vigil. As quietly as he could, he exited the building, closing the door gently behind him. He frantically checked himself all over for any sign of the creature, but found no trace. Pulling it from his jacket he began feverishly leafing through the _Index Superno_ Cressida had given him.

He stopped at a page and began to read it. As his eyes reached the bottom of it his jaw set.

“Oh no.”

> December, 1865

Elsie was in a hurry. If she was late again she would be in trouble. The bruises from her last lack of punctuality were only just healed. The Lord Chamberlain, The Viscount Sydney, was a hard and unforgiving master.

As she neared the Queen’s study she smoothed out her dress, preparing herself for inspection. Young housemaids were easily removed from service. Elsie had seen it happen many times before.

The door was slightly ajar. She was always told_: Doors in Windsor Castle are either open or closed, and never in between._ She made to close the offending door when she heard a few words spoken gruffly from within, which halted her. It was without a doubt a Scots accent. She knelt and looked through the key-hole.

Standing before her desk she saw the Queen in her now customary mourning dress. Below her she saw Mr. John Brown, down on one knee, and he seemed to be placing a ring on the Queen’s finger. The Queen lifted her hand to her face, examining the ring. And the Queen did something Elsie had never seen her do before. Queen Victoria smiled. She beamed so broadly her cheek muscles might burst. It was so infectious Elsie found herself smiling.

Even on bended knee John was near her height.

"Not as fancy as yer used tae."

"It is beautiful, John."

"It belonged tae ma grandmother. And now it belongs tae y—”

Elsie lost her balance for the briefest of moments and her shoe scuffed against the door.

“Who’s there?” the Scot roared, his head snapping around. He powered to his feet and stormed towards the door, clattering it open. 

There was no-one there. Not a soul. John glared up and down the corridor but saw no-one. As he scanned for intruders he absent-mindedly scratched at his neck through his beard. Then he scratched at his cheek. Then he scratched a little harder. Then the irritation was gone.

“John?” came the Queen’s voice from the study. He stepped back into the room and closed the doors behind him.

Around the corner Elsie tip-toed down the corridor, carefully avoiding the creaks in the floorboards that would give her away. Surely she had not seen what she thought she had seen. Surely not.

Elsie felt her heart begin to race as the magnitude of what she may have witnessed turned over in her mind. She would be the talk of Palace! Her pace quickened and she near danced from silent floorboard to silent floorboard.

Launching around another corner, unable to stop herself in time she barrelled into the Lord Chamberlain striding powerfully in the other direction, flanked by his skinny assistant. Elsie bounced off of him and sprawled to the floor. Behind his thick, grey mutton-chop sideburns his face went a terrifying shade of red. 

"Stand up, girl!" Elsie did so. "Late yet again!"

"But milord, I can explain—”

"Silence!"

"But milord, Mr. Brown is to marry Her Majesty! I just saw him propo—”

The backhanded slap dropped Elsie to the floor. The tears were involuntary. Her hand instinctively went to her face where his ring had caught her cheek. There was blood.

"Impudence! Out with you, girl. Your services will no longer be required. Remove yourself and your belongings from this household forthwith!"

She peeled herself up off of the carpet and head bowed made her way to a hidden servant’s entrance. Her tears were falling freely as she opened it, and Elsie disappeared into the gloom.

Having watched her go, the Lord Chamberlain resumed his stride down the corridor.

“Take a letter. “ He said to the air in front of him, the words clearly directed to his waif of an assistant struggling to keep up. “To the Editor, _Punch_ magazine. We should meet and discuss a certain Highlander.”

> May, 1866

As the carriage pulled into the House of Lords, Cressida Cadwallader pushed her way to the front of the thronging crowds. The cheers echoed in her mind as Queen Victoria stepped down from the carriage to formally open Parliament and deliver her speech from the Throne. 

Cressida raised a small Adder Stone to her eye and gazed intently at the Queen. Emanating from her was a bright, white aura, strong, formidable and nearly blinding. Circling around her, wheeling, diving and attacking were swarms of the dark, leather-winged creatures, but against the solid, bright sphere of power bursting forth from the Queen they were easily repulsed, each one reeling in pain and dropping to the ground.

She lowered the stone and placed it back into her purse.

“Well done, Mr. Brown.”

> Windsor Castle  
> March, 1872

The servants surrounded his bed as a grey-haired John Brown—his face and arms a bright, fiery red—tossed and scratched at his skin in obvious agony. A doctor went about his ministrations as Mrs Brown tried to mop his brow, but he could not stay still and his loud groans and wails were getting too much for her. She tightened the muscles of her jaw, holding in tears. If she allowed herself to weep, she feared might never stop.

The doctor stepped away from the bed, John’s wife following. His manner was grave.

“It is pneumonia, and necrosis of the skin.”

“What can you do for him, Doctor?.” 

The doctor looked her in the eye and briefly shook his head. She took a deep, shaky breath, her eyes wide with concern. She nearly let out a sob but caught herself.

“Doctor, no. No, surely there’s something you can do. Surely, Doctor, there’s something _we_ can do.”

“I’m sorry, Margaret. I’ve tried everything within my power. I’m afraid for this there simply is no remedy."

"He is to d—” she couldn't say the word. “How long?” She whispered.

“I’m sorry, Mrs Brown. Most likely tonight.” He whispered. “Do your best to make him comfortable.”

Margaret closed her eyes and fought for control. The doctor hugged her and solemnly made his way out of the room. As if floating she returned to his bedside. _This can’t be happening._

Passing the doctor in the doorway, Cressida Cadwallader respectfully entered the room, her hair now grey, her skin somewhat thinner and wrinkled but her posture unchanged from the day she and John had first met. At the back of the room she lifted her small Adder Stone to her eye and scanned the room. Crawling over John Brown’s bed was a seething mass of small, dark leather-winged creatures. They licked and gnawed and scratched at his bright red flesh. He groaned with every bite and he scratched at the already raw skin. She put the Adder Stone back in her purse and drew a short irritated breath, closed her eyes and shook her head, the conclusion of the next few hours all too clear. 

Cressida approached the bed and laid her hand on John’s arm. His breathing was rapid, his brow furrowed against the pain above eyes that were distant. His body and bedding were soaked with the sweat of fever. John was somewhere else, she observed, fighting his last fight, making his last move in a game he knew was coming to a close. For a moment it seemed he was distracted from his agonising throes. After some searching she caught his eye, watching him fight for and win a brief moment of lucidity.She took his trembling hand and placed something into his grip. 

“Thank you for your service, Mr. Brown.”

They stared at each other for a few moments. John nodded his head sharply between tortured breaths. He opened his palm to see a white Queen chess piece, polished to a mirror sheen. He closed his fist around the Queen and held it tight to his chest. His breathing grew shallow as he looked up to the heavens above him, remembering. A lifetime of service. A life saved, pulled back from the brink of despair. A game well played. An honourable end.

His eyes were euphoric as they slowly but inevitably rolled to the back of his head, his final ordeal beginning, a low groan coming from deep within him.

As he tossed in the throes of another fit, something fell to the floor. Cressida retrieved it and stood up. It was the dark Queen chess piece from Balmoral. Once black, its raised areas had been worn away over the years, revealing the unstained wood beneath. Catching the eye of John’s wife, she hesitated in a brief moment of reflection, then she pressed the chess piece into his wife’s hand and nodded her condolences. 

Cressida looked for one last time upon John Brown, most loyal and trusted Servant to Queen Victoria, perhaps longer than was appropriate, her face unreadable. The servants surrounding the bed raised their heads looking at her, heralding looming questions. John let out a long, painful moan.

Cressida bowed her head to the death-bed in front of her, then turned and left the room. The cries of John Brown’s last, torturous hours echoed in her ears.

> Windsor Castle  
> February, 1901

Edward VII, King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Emperor of India, sat reading a book of his Mother’s hand. A pile of Queen Victoria’s personal diaries were sitting on the table.

Bertie, now overweight and grey, could not concentrate. The memories of today's events would not leave his mind. It was a military funeral, as befitted the Head of the Army. The Queen had left instructions that her body was to be dressed in white. _White_!

Bertie had helped ritually lift his Mother into her coffin. He watched as a dressing gown belonging to his Father, Prince Albert, and a plaster cast of his hand was laid down beside Her. He was taken aback when a small picture of John Brown was placed in her hand, followed by what he had to assume was a lock of the man's hair. His revulsion led him to examine Her body more closely. He noticed a ring on Her finger he had not seen before. A simple gold ring, unbefitting of an Empress. He had heard the sordid and unfounded rumours, as had most of the country—such is the way of the masses to gossip. Rarely were any rumours about their betters ever true. He had chosen as ever not to believe a word. 

So now after the funeral he read his Mother's most personal of writings to put paid to his own miniscule but creeping concerns. It had not gone well.

_“I feel I have here always in the House a good, devoted soul whose only object and interest is in my service, & God knows how much I want to be taken care of.”_

He slammed shut the diary and threw it to his butler standing in attendance. 

“Burn it,” he said.

Edward took a long sip from his brandy glass. He put a cigar to his mouth and struck a match.

“Burn all of them.”
