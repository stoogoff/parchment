---


A gull wheels across the sky at sunset, keen eyes surveying the surf. Unlike its compatriots, it is not seeking sustenance. This gull has a mission. It dips its ink-tipped wings and dives, dives, dives. Over the entrance to the chain pier, causing considerable consternation among the pedestrians populating the promenade, over the Victoria fountain with its stone dolphins. It rests briefly on the lip of a balustrade on the Royal Pavilion, not so much as to get its bearings as to gather its thoughts. Will they remember the ancient compact? Will they honour it, as their mother and father would have wished? Will they be of suitable character and bearing to deal with the resurgent menace?

Scratching its beak against a wing—it is unused to such complicated thoughts and doesn't really want them—it flaps down to the Theatre Royal opposite and raps politely on a small window to the left of the stage door. Then it paces back and forth, pecking occasionally at the fine film of dust while it waits for a reply. Beyond that window in a stuffy, undersized dressing room, two figures argue in raised but perfectly formed voices. 

“Clementine, dear heart, please be sparing with the foundation. We haven't a lot left.” The voice is clear, somewhat shrill in its indignation, and loud enough to be heard in any of the dressing rooms, though not on the stage.

“Oh Clement, joy of my life, please do shut your perpetually whingeing cakehole and pass me my moustache.” This voice is deeper—heartier somehow—but no less sonorous.

There is a knock at the door—fragile, unsure—and it opens slightly. A nervous figure enters with a tray.

“Champagne for you both. And chocolates.” He indicates a small box stuffed with peppermint creams fashioned to resemble miniature seashells.

“Well, that's thoughtful. Isn't that thoughtful, sister of mine?”

The gull looks on nervously, trying to peek through the thick layer of grime. It hops back and forth for a few moments, making sure it has the right window, and taps again furiously. If these two are meant to save the day, then the day is in a lot of trouble—not to mention tomorrow.

Finally, the window creaks open ever so slightly, enough for it to stick its head through and fully inspect the appointed saviours of the town. As it does, it is met with a shriek of horror which only a trained actor could muster.

“Shoo! Get away, wretched vermin!” A procession of objects, ever increasing in size and hardness, are catapulted in its direction. It dodges deftly, then realights on the sill and—in a welcome interlude to the harassment—scratches with its beak in the dirt.

_IT HAS RETURNED_

Both the humans in the room change their demeanour rapidly. They invite it inside, even prepare it a cushion, now they’re aware what it is.

Not just a gull. A harbinger of ill omen. A message from beyond the grave, somehow—from their own dear father, departed sadly these 22 years. This is the day they were warned about. A day they have been preparing for—just not one they had expected to interrupt their three week star billing at the Theatre Royal.

“Clementine, sister dearest?” 

“Yes, brother of mine?”

“It’s time to get things started.” Clementine was already removing some of the more obvious elements of her outfit—the top hat, the glue-on moustache, the outlandish monocle that gave her stage gentleman-persona that air of distinction.

Clement had a much longer job of it. He was still removing layers of crinoline, bustle and silk bloomers as his sister watched in what would have been taken for impatience had it not been punctuated with occasional bouts of mirth. Finally, in a last act of exasperation, he clutched at his pearls and declared: “Oh, do help me, sister of mine. It’s one thing to be seen in this on the stage, it’s quite another to wear it on the street, let alone when we are about Society business!”

Clementine reached over, snatching her brothers hands together imperiously and commanding him to stand still while she disengaged him from masses of female undergarments. When she was done, Clement pecked her on the cheek by means of thanks.

“Where would I be without you? Now, where’s our avian visitor gone?”

“He’s behind you.” 

The two of them turned round together and regarded the gull with utmost seriousness. 

“Can it talk, do you think?”

“Not so, brother dear, not so. It is a mere messenger. A warning that another threat from the sea has come. We must act swiftly to determine the nature of the menace. Are you ready to travel?”

“As good as I can be. Besides, nobody will really notice in the dark. We’re bound to attract some attention, but we’ve carefully cultivated an air of eccentricity that will serve us well. Ready when you are!”

At that, they left their dressing room and made their way to the stage door, evading angry glances from both stagehands and their producer. The show must go on, but tonight it was a different show. 

Back in the dressing room, the lone gull looked up wearily, grabbed one of the elegantly wrapped chocolate shells in its beak and flew back out of the window, high and away into the night air.

Clementine June Weatherlie and Clement August Weatherlie made their way from the stage door through the dingy alley at the back of the theatre and ran briskly across the road, lest they be recognised by the crowd outside the door who had come to see them perform. This managed, Clementine took a key from her reticule while her brother looked over his shoulder ready to fend off any autograph hunters. The key fitted perfectly into a little know door in the grounds of the Pavilion, a door that had not seen much use since the death of their father in the great storm of 1850. They were entering the local archives of the Aletheian Society—masses of parchments, tomes, objets d’art and occult paraphernalia meticulously collected by the previous generations who had served in the Society—including their dear departed father—and equally meticulously catalogued and maintained by their erstwhile personages. While they had dealt with all manner of supernatural threats in their time, they had been ultimately preparing for what they called _The Threat From The Sea_ (they both agreed it was worthy of capitalisation)—the very threat that had caused the great storm and taken their father from them too soon.

“Father’s notes are quite clear on this, as you are aware.”

Clement nodded in reply. “It would do us good to have a last review of them, I think, before we execute the plan of action.”

“Agreed. Please be so kind, brother dear, to pass me ‘_The Book of All The Ancient Customs_’ and father’s notes."

Clement fumbled at the latch of a cabinet, his hands shaking slightly, and opened it to reveal a treasure of terrible tomes. He reached for a weighty volume which had the singular pleasure of its own shelf and looked at the catch, fashioned to resemble two dolphins chasing each other.

The book set firmly on the table, Clementine opened it with tremulous hands and wondrous eyes. Here was the prize of their collection: the tome which bore the ancient compact between the fisherfolk of the shore and the townsfolk who had arrived later. Two copies of this tome existed—one for each party—and it was a matter of some consternation that the twins did not know which copy they had or how their father—on behalf of the Society—had come to procure it.

The volume itself was old—as old as the town of Brighthelmston—and the hinged dolphins gave way creakily to reveal the text inside. The contents were familiar to the twins, who had pored over it a thousand times in preparation for this day; how the townsfolk and the fisherfolk had banded together to rid the ancient town of the first menace from the sea, carefully annotated illustrations of its malevolent form and how to defeat it when it rose again. Of central concern in the appendices to the tome penned by their father was the following passage about how the threat became manifest:

_“There has always been perceived among those who dwell on the coast a danger from the ocean that those who live inland cannot understand, whether from onshore storm, flooding or malevolent aquatic fauna. Periodically, unknown triggers bring forth what I am forced to conclude is a manifestation of the collected consciousness made flesh; an enemy that can be fought and, one must hope, vanquished. This has been so since the first stories of knuckers in water-holes and talk of dragons in Ethelward’s Chronicles.”_

“So,” muttered Clement, “Are we to be gallant knights-errant and slay the beast with weapons? Or are we going to be more like the cunning Jim Pulk and bake it a poison pie? I confess my skills at either are somewhat lacking.”

“Wits, I think, win the day,” replied Clementine, “At least that would be my preference. Also, given the cyclical nature of attack and defence that father noted, I suspect we will have to face that poison ourselves—though it what manner I find hard to deduce—and should thus be prepared.”

“Oh, joys,” quipped Clement. “Can it be a surfeit of champagne? At least then I can die happily."

“Hush! No talk of dying, please, brother dearest. I think we need to bring this matter to the attention of the third member of our little circle and see what he has to say.”

Clement harrumphed. “He never seems to say anything of import. But lead on!”

"Well, let’s be away then and see what wisdom he’s in the mood to dispense today.”

***

Namrik had technically been a member of the Aletheian Society for fifty-two years, which would have made him one of the Society’s longest-serving members were he actually a human being. Instead—its consciousness being a result of a wishing lamp being accidentally soldered onto one of Charles Babbage’s prototype computational contraptions—Namrik was forced to eke out a meagre existence as a fortune telling machine beneath the chain pier; a favourite among the weekend crowd but a pale imitation of an unfulfilled destiny. The twins had first been introduced to him by their parents when they were young; it was only in discussion with the elders of the Aletheian Society that Namrik’s true history had come to the fore. It remained a mystery to Clement why the Society placed more stock in this machine than the abilities of their human agents. It was less of a mystery to Clementine, who was currently wondering why Clement was only wearing one shoe.

Clement fumbled in his pocket for a shilling and inserted it wearily into the slot. Namrik sprang into life, the cogs and wheels clicking and computing as the automaton’s piercing blue eyes searched for the image of who had deigned to disturb him. Some two minutes later, after a not inconsiderable amount of jerky hand-waving beneath ill-tailored silk sleeves, the machine spat out a token. Clement withdrew it from the machine and looked it over.

YOU WILL MEET A TALL DARK STRANGER

Clement sighed.

“Let me try,” muttered Clementine. “Pass me a shilling, darling brother of mine.”  Namrik’s eyes glowed blue momentarily—had they ever done that before? she wondered—and there followed a long period of silence interrupted only by a series of clacks and whirrs until, eventually, his wisdom spent, Namrik spat out a second token which she turned over in her hand. Upon it there were no words, merely a picture of a shell. For a moment, she was one of mind with her brother.

“I’ve seen that before!” Clement exclaimed, tugging on her sleeve, “Somewhere recently…”

“Oh, do think clearly!” Clementine held her brother’s hands in hers as she implored him to remember.

“In the tome! Wait, no, in father’s notes! It’s an ammonite!”

“Of course! It’s a facsimile of a fossil, not anything current. The architect Amon Wilds decorated buildings with them all over the city, as a play on his name. And he was father’s chief suspect, he accused Wilds of using his architecture as a geomantic summoning grid writ large over the whole town! That must be what Namrik is trying to tell us!”

“Wilds must be dead by now though, surely?” Clementine resisted the urge to slap her sibling. They should both be aware by now that things didn’t always stay dead, especially after the Punch and Judy incident last summer. Luckily, he corrected himself with an ‘oh,’ and then tailed off. 

“He died in 1833, brother dear, suspiciously only a few days after the collapse of the Anthaeum. It was the architecture, not the architect that father suspected.”

Clement straightened himself. “Well, nothing a few blows with a pickaxe won’t cure, then! We can smash those shells and be done in one night!”.

“We will need that pickaxe, that’s true. Also maybe a shovel. Brother dear, we need to raise the dead.”

***

“The trouble with the dead,” Clement mused as he wiped sweat from his brow. “Is that they should stay dead.” He paused for a moment, leaning on the pickaxe in the ill-lit graveyard on top of the hill. It was trivial enough to find the architect’s grave—there was a bloody great ammonite on it—but digging it up was hard work, especially as Clementine had insisted he did the work alone while she kept vigil.’ 

They had made their way to the rear of the churchyard undisturbed—it was past midnight now, they thought. The only person they had seen in the vicinity was a tall man dressed in an impeccable dark blue suit and matching top hat, who seemed quite unaware of their presence and was content to stare intently into the night sky, softly calling, as they crept past.

Now though, as she stood shivering, Clementine became acutely aware that they were being watched—by someone or something—and it gave her chills beyond that of a dark summer’s night. 

“Are you done yet?” she inquired over her shoulder.

Clement grunted in reply.

Then it came. A pair of glowing green eyes, descending at them from the heavens, and with it a vicious looking beak and long, white wings locked in a silent swoop.

“Aagh! Get away!”

Alerted by his sister’s cry, Clement wasted no time in scrabbling from the half-dug grave to stand next to her, pickaxe at the ready, as Clementine removed a talisman from her reticule and flashed it before them in a series of rapid movements.

The gull dived again, but this time appeared to bounce off an impenetrable, invisible barrier and waddled away, stunned and reeling.

“I say! That was a rather good trick!”

“It only works once. Quick, let us find some cover.”

“They’re not normally that vicious!”

“Yes they are! What they aren’t—normally—is nocturnal. Or possessed.” Clementine ducked behind a tomb as the gull took off.

“Oh.” Clement flailed at it with the pickaxe as it dived toward him.

“We need to get out of here, something is very wrong…”

“You’re telling me! Possessed seagulls!? Whatever next!”

“Possessed actors?. That’s the same seagull that warned us in our dressing room.” She dived behind a tombstone as the screeching began again. The gull wheeled in an arc across the night sky, biding its time

“Huh?”

“The ammonite shape, we’ve seen that before.”

“I know, it’s..”

“Not in father’s notes! In the dressing room. It’s the same shape as the chocolates that were delivered to us.”

Clement tripped and sank to his muddied knees; Clementine swung back and helped him up.

“The gull has parts of the green wrapper stuck on its beak.”

Clement looked aghast. “I confess I didn’t look that closely…”

“Run! Now!”

The two of them leapt out of cover and high-tailed it into what they hoped was the relative protection of the church. Momentarily safe, they gasped to recover both their breath and their wits.

“So, you think the chocolates were poisoned?”

“I believe them to be part of Namrik’s warning. As dangers from the sea go, though…” Clementine peered out from under the porch towards the sky. “I’ll take a gull over a shark. But we need to get back, first to the theatre to inspect the chocolates and then back to the archives for their safekeeping.”

“You don’t think the cast have…” Clement tailed off.

“Think, oh joy of my existence, when was the last time you helped yourself to something unattended in a dressing room?”

“Oh Lord! We must make all haste!”

“Exactly.”

The twins made short work of the journey back to the theatre, but the scene that greeted them was not what they expected. Entering through the stage door, ever alert, they had expected to encounter an entire cast of show-stopping actors with glowing eyes of emerald green. What they found instead, daubed on the walls in blue paint, was a series of glyphs that rendered them insensible. Both succumbed to the mind numbing drowsiness the graffiti induced in them, collapsing first to their knees and then giving in to the oblivion of sleep.

***

Silence. Near darkness. Only a dim twinkling from overhead, a reflection from the moon outside through layers of expensive glass.

Struggling with her bonds, Clementine called out to her brother.

“Clement, are you there?”

“Present, sister dearest.”

“Where the Dickens are we, do you imagine?”

“We're in the Regent's Saloon, inside the Pavilion.”

Clementine looked over, quizzically.

“I recognise the outline of the chandelier and this particular carpet stain."

Quite how her brother was intimately familiar with the interior decor of the ballroom could wait for another day.

“Help me out, would you? I can just about reach my knife, if you loosen my rope a little…”

“Enough.” A booming voice echoed throughout the room, quelling all attempts at escape.

“You will answer for your crime.”

“Pray, what crime might that be?” Clementine replied sweetly, with only a tiny hint of sarcasm. “And while we're on the subject, since when do trials take place in the dead of night in formerly-royal apartments?”

“Since Queen Victoria was persuaded to relinquish the Pavilion to us, The Society of Twelve.”

Clementine hadn’t actually been expecting an answer; but if she had, this was the answer she would have wanted.

“Free us and show yourselves! I believe we can come to an accord against the return of true evil to our beloved town. I say to you now, whose sacred societal name is known to me, that we are not your enemies.”

There followed a series of hushed, frenzied whispers and the same voice spoke. 

“Very well. We will show ourselves.”

A flickering of light; the flare of a lantern. Then, the Society revealed their true forms to the horror of their still-bound prisoners.   

***

Had Clementine still been wearing her monocle, it would at this point have fallen comically from her face at the sight before them. She looked over at her brother. Clement, for his part, was clutching his fist in his mouth in a semblance of fear. Though it was just possible, she thought, that he was doing it to stifle a giggle.

“We are, as you can see, naturists.”

One must assume that the sight of the twelve society members in their altogether was used predominantly as a shock tactic. On this occasion, it had been found wanting. There was an awkward pause measured only by the uncomfortable shuffling of feet. Clementine, who had seen more semi- or unclothed persons in her theatrical career than she cared to think about, merely blinked and then retorted.

“And we, as you can see, are cross-dressing thespian twins. We are also the representatives of the Aletheian Society in Brighton, sworn by sacred duty to protect the realm of her majesty from supernatural incursions and malignant otherworldly artefacts.”

“The Leafy Urn Society?” The same voice boomed, but with a mouth behind it this time; a mouth attached to a face and a naked body which was somehow glowing now with its own cerulean light. “Never heard of you.”

“What gives you the right to hold secret court over our fates?” This new outburst came from Clement, still struggling with the ropes. “From what sacristy do you proclaim dominion over the unseen and unworldly, as we do?”

“By ancient compact, we protect this town from monstrous incursions from the ocean,” the voice intoned. Clementine could make out more of the form attached to that voice now as it shuffled slowly forward. A thin, translucent man, but a man nonetheless. He trailed behind him some contraption which seemed to be affixed to the rear of his neck and upper arms by lengths of translucent tubing, through which ran a clear liquid. What fresh madness was this?

“Inter Undes et Colles Floremus.” The intonation echoed through the superb acoustics of the Regent’s Saloon.

“What’s he saying?” Clement was frantic now. “What’s he _summoning_?” He was nearly free of the ropes with all the frenzied struggling, but his sister had stayed unflinching, still bound..

“Hush, brother dearest.That’s the town motto.”

“By the Book Of All The Ancient Customs of the Toune of Brighthelmston, we are bound to protect the coast from the dangers of the sea.”

Clementine wasn’t going to question where he’d produced the book from. There were some things that were best left unanswered. As he drew closer, his full visage became visible by the lantern light and its own eerie inner glow; gaunt, haggard and speckled with liver spots, the vestige of a grey beard trailing to his neck; beneath it, barely visible, a recognisable form in amber at his throat. An ammonite.

For the first time in this sorry affair, Clementine gasped.

“You’re him! You’re Amon Wilds!”

“Indeed, young woman. And I am, as you can see, neither dead nor buried.”

Clement, who had wrestled free from bondage at last, rose and turned to look at the ancient man now all but hunched over his sister. Whatever he was about to do, he had better do it quickly. As Wilds raised the book in his hand, however, he found himself commenting rather than confronting.

“Oh! The Book of Customs! We have one of those in the basement, don’t we, Clementine my heart?”

Clementine sighed. All their cards were revealed, all the tension had left the situation. The other eleven members were at first intensely shocked at this news, then mollified.

“If that is so, then you are the partners we hoped for.” Wilds spoke for them all. “Let us speak further.”

***   

“Father was convinced it was you.” They had all settled in now like old friends, taking sips in Fitzherbert’s after hours. “Said the ammonites gave you away. The exact form that was needed to summon creatures from the depths.”

“Such an object, once used for one purpose, can be more easily diverted to the opposite. The ammonite architecture protects us all now—to some extent—by the principles of sacred geometry. Safe enough for most of us, but not her royal personage, which is why she was advised to vacate the Pavilion and leave the building to us.” He added a brief afterthought. “And I keep myself alive, as it were, by having the life-giving seawaters of Brighton running through my veins rather than blood.”

“How is it you have a copy of our book?” interjected Clement, sour at being left out of the discussion. 

“When the customs were first inscribed, two copies were made. One remained in the town in a chest secured by three locks, which has been guarded by the Dippers on behalf of the Twelve ever since. We did not know what happened to the other.”

“Somehow it either fell into father’s hands before he was recruited by the Aletheian Society, or he was already a member and procured it,” finished Clementine, quaffing back another tot of gin. “We may never know..”

“You must return it to the fisherfolk in the morning. That much is imperative. We will take care of your cast until the work is done. I’m sure it won’t be the first time some of them have spent the night in the cells.” Wilds was thoughtful. “Do you think our plan will work? Are you prepared to enact it?”

“We will need to rest first. But yes, we’ll do it.” 

“Then we will see you there, in Pool Valley, to lend our aid.” 

It had not escaped the twins’ notice that this was exactly where their father had died.

***

Dawn is a taxing time of day; more so when one has only had three hours sleep at most. Clement rubbed his eyes and groaned, standing behind his sister on the mist-laden beach, chill with morning air.

Clementine stood in conversation with three fishermen, pipes lit and arms folded. She repeated the words Wilds had taught her to say. “By ancient compact, we claim our rights to one twelfth of all your sardines.” Eyebrows were raised, and one among them stepped forward.

“You are new. You are from them?”

“We are from another… it’s complicated. We’re working with them, but we are also the ones in possession of your tome.” She snapped her fingers and Clement moved forward at the cue, nearly tripping on the unstable shingle. He handed it over. They spoke among themselves for a few moments in a strange cant Clementine couldn’t make out.

“It’s back. We have a plan to take it out, but we need your consent and your control over the tome to be restored.”

“And a few fishing nets would be good, maybe a harpoon or two.” Clement was impatient, shivering.

“Aye, we’ve sensed its approach. We’ve also guessed that the newly built aquarium is designed to act as a prison for it. Is that true?”

“It is. Do we go now?”

“Just to Pool Valley. We can use its unique position as the underground confluence of the Wellesbourne and the Westerbourne streams to imprison its physical form, but it won’t go easily.” Clementine had been impressed with the scale of Wild’s plan. From the Aquarium to the new Goldstone pumping station, it seemed that all the recent construction in Brighton had been designed for this specific purpose.

The fisherman nodded, then turned and shouted to the others who were busy preparing their nets. Clement stood alongside his sister. 

“They’ve agreed to it then! Good.” Clementine turned, quizzically. 

“You understand their cant? Brother dear, you do amaze me!” 

“Sister of mine, that is Polari. It’s used by fishmongers and queens both. I can understand every word of it. Shall we go?” 

The twins walked grimly, hand in hand, to the place of confrontation, trailed by a dozen hardy fisherfolk with a host of barbed weapons.   

***

Whatever they had expected at Pool Valley, it certainly wasn’t nothing. In the dim glow of the dawn, the twins and their allies surveyed the scene. No storm, no flooding, no menace. One of the shops was open, however, which was certainly strange at this time. Clement nudged his sister.

“‘Edmunds Chocolates.’ Must be the place” As if at their bidding, a thin frame appeared at the doorway, human but barely so, eyes lit with a blazing emerald green. One harpoon flew over their head and clattered harmlessly to the floor at its feet. Enraged, it let out an unearthly screech and dropped to all fours. 

“Now!” shouted Clement. Two of the Society of Twelve, marked as their ‘Dipper’ guards by their elegant bathing costumes, struggled with the manholes to the drains as the fishermen began to encircle the enemy.

It grew in size, audibly popping joints and letting out howls as it did so. Clouds began to gather overhead, blotting out the sun, and then it started to rain. The scaled monstrosity that now gibbered and writhed before them struck out with a savage claw, rending one brave fisherman in half.

“Westerbourne, now!” Clementine roared the order, struggling now to be heard above the torrential rain. There was a great clunk and the drain gushed forth its load; fresh water to add to the rain. The creature hesitated slightly, spinning its slavering jaws in torment.

“Wellesbourne!” The second drain opened, the swell of the Wellesbourne spreading from the drain at the opposite side of the courtyard.

“Clementine! It’s working!” Wilds, surveying from above, shouted. “But it’s not enough! Dam the coastal barrage, that will divert the flows! We must cross the streams!”

The twins cursed as the creature shrugged off attack after attack. The water was ankle deep now as they sloshed their way toward the promenade, deftly avoiding tooth and claw alike in their struggle. The Twelve had nearly finished the barrage— just a few sandbags left— 

The draconic form writhed and twisted, held down now by nets and constrained by the fresh water flushing the poison from its mind and body. It lashed furiously over and over again, gibbering, howling, the light dying within it until it was no more than a shell of itself. 

Clementine paused for a breath. “It’s done.”

Wilds approached, dragging his brine tank behind him. “It is over. We can take it from here. We thank the Aletheian Society for its valuable assistance.”

Clementine nodded. “If you ever need us again, you know where we are. Although don’t try and enter without permission. There will be consequences.”

“I might say the same of us. Still, there is no reason not to be cordial.”

“Quite.” Clementine turned to her brother. “We’re on stage in three hours. Ready for it?” 

“After this?” grinned Clement. “Child’s play!” He sauntered off toward the Pavilion loudly singing a bawdy ditty. Clementine, with a sigh and a smile, followed him.
