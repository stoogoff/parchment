While of course my natural red-blooded vim is not to be denied, even the great steam-engine Cadwallader must occasionally pause to take on water and coal (or in this case a healthful porter and a few morsels of soused pig’s face, courtesy of our housekeeper, Mrs Gillespie). I was just in the process of rising in the most military fashion to the challenge of demolishing my scran when the blasted telegraph arrived, with blasted Arthur attached to it by one sweaty mitt.

“Dr Cadwallader! Dr Cadwallader! We’re being called to action!”

I laid a jaundiced eye across both the offending articles before me, noting the Tribune’s seal on one and the smile of total idiocy on the other. Still, a soldier doesn’t surrender their weapon at the first sign of the enemy; I tightened my grip on the cutlery and decided to try and bull through. “I’m sure it’s nothing that won’t wait an hour or two, Arthur, until the rest of the Chapter are here. No point going off half-cocked, now, is there?”

“Oh no, Dr Cadwallader, it’s highly urgent—the Tribune instructs that you specifically must…”—he lifted the damnable thing and recited verbatim—“immediately, and without any delay of any kind proceed to the location detailed below, on pain of… does that really say _scourging_?”

I sighed heavily, drained the porter and stood, “Like Prometheus upon the rock, it is ever my fate to be tormented—in my case by having my meals snatched away from me before they’re hardly begun!”

“Wasn’t lunch only an hour and a half ago?” he queried with measured innocence.

“It’s the principle of the thing, Roxburgh! Come on then, fetch a cab while I accoutre meself.”

How to describe the so-called “Second City of the Empire” to an outsider from more civilised lands? ‘A wretched cesspool of belching chimneys, grime and squalor’ hardly comes close to conveying the abject misery of the place. Half the citizens are possessed of an utter brazen criminality while the other half make a joyless show of their piety and sobriety. Add the barrier that language places on the ability to communicate in any intelligible fashion, and you achieve a morass that Bosch himself would have trembled to bring to the canvas.

Arthur put his head to one side. “So what is this ‘Necronomicon’—some old Greek text, I’m assuming? Let me think for a second: ‘_Book of the names of the dead_’, is that right? I don’t remember ever reading about it in classics, and we were taught a pretty comprehensive spread.”

“Yes, well if you’d been taught from the Necronomicon, I suspect the lesson would have been brief but memorable, my boy. As the name implies, it’s for summoning up the spirits of the dead. Nasty piece of practitioners’ hardware, and one that we chuck on the nearest bonfire whenever a copy rears its wormy head. Blasted thing is nothing but trouble—no idea what makes the Tribune think there’d be a copy in Glasgow, of all places.”

“Well we are heading to a shipping yard—perhaps it’s only passing through on its way to somewhere else?”

I harrumphed noncommittally, “Remind me to see if these shipping johnnies can do me a box of cigars on the cheap.”

“After our mission is complete, of course?” he put in reproachfully.

I sighed; Lord Arthur Roxburgh is the human equivalent of a thoroughbred hound—handsomely proportioned, glossy coat, enthusiastic bounce to the step, and inbred to the point of virtual imbecility. Never having had to worry about material needs, he has little understanding of the travails of those of us who have to exist a little more hand-to-mouth.

The cab pulled to a halt, and we were met with the malodorous reek of the docks. I pointed at the sign: ‘Burrell Shipping’. 

“Well, here we are then. Pay the man, Arthur.”

Roxburgh goggled at me for a second before actually apologising and fumbling out his coin purse. Before you sit in judgement, remember he’s pretty well padded while I live on the Society’s meagre payouts and whatever family money I can wring from the miserly claws of Aunt Cressie.

Upon entering we found a boy of no more than ten or eleven sitting at the counter before an open ledger. 

“Halloo there young chap, might we have a word with the proprietor?”

“I’m afraid my da’s nae aboot, sir. I’m happy tae take a message, or if it’s just pickup or dropoff, I can sign fer it.”

I decided to try the soft soap first, “What’s yer name, lad?”

“William, sir.”

“Capital, capital. I tell you what, Bill old man, perhaps you can help us, yes. We’re looking for a rare antique book, probably just came in the last day or two?”

Bill’s face took on a calculating look—one I’ve seen used by buyers at market when sizing up animals for the slaughter. “A pound,” he said at last, cool as a cucumber.

“I beg your pardon?”

“Ye want tae know where the delivery went, I want a pound. Sounds like a deal tae me.”

At this point I decided to abandon bonhomie, “How about I come round there and box your ears for you, you little dromedary!” 

I lunged for the ledger, but Bill grabbed it, slid neatly off his seat and put his back to a door on the far wall. “One shout and I’ve got twenty of my da’s dockers in here tae pummel ye.”

I growled, but it seemed we were at an impasse, “All right then… Arthur, pay the boy!”

“Oh, er, of course. A pound was it?”

“Naw, two pounds now, thanks tae auld whiskers tryin’ tae steal wur book.”

“This is daylight robbery! We shan’t stand for it!”

“Three pounds.”

“Throw in a box of cigars as goodwill?”

“Four pounds.”

“Dash it, all, he’s got us over a barrel—just pay him, Arthur.”

“Please, Dr Cadwallader, stop negotiating, I haven’t any more money on me!”

And so for the princely sum of four pounds we got the shipping details and final destination of the Necronomicon. We hailed another cab and divided the labour evenly—I attended to my hip flask while Arthur leafed through the documentation, “Arrived from the Americas yesterday evening… delivered to Clayslaps Mill in Partick this morning.”

“To Partick, then—and don’t spare the horses, cabbie!” I quickly had cause to regret engaging the cab-driver in conversation. From what I could understand of his diatribe, he was making a bitterly xenophobic complaint about foreign cab drivers stealing jobs from him and his kinsmen. Arthur has quite the ear for foreign tongues, and even he can barely understand the local patois. Thankfully the man’s polemic against the nations of the world didn’t get as far as Switzerland, or else I believe Arthur would have dueled him right there in the street. He’s as gentle as a lamb in most regards, but an insult to his wife, or indeed anyone of the female persuasion, can raise a chivalrous ire in the boy.

At length we pulled up at the mill on the banks of the Kelvin, only to find a large crowd already gathered near the squat building with its lapping waterwheel. The gongoozlers were looking at the river itself, which instead of running its usual industrial cocoa-brown had turned a quite violent shade of arterial crimson. The waterwheel dripped scarlet gore as it slowly turned.

“This bodes.” I said, checking my revolver, “Someone has already begun attempting to use the book.”

“Yes, that does look a bit… biblical.”

“At least they’re all focused on the river, not the mill itself. Let’s have a gander and see if we can’t find a way in…”

By means of a cart which was standing unattended we managed to haul ourselves up to loading area relatively unscathed and proceed inside. Although it had been a little brisk outside, within the mill it was positively frigid. We pressed forward in the freezing darkness, the only sound the groaning of the turning waterwheel.

“I say, Doctor Cadwallader, there’s a light ahead.” Sure enough there was a ribbon of pale light shining under a door ahead—not the comforting yellow glow of a lantern, or even the sputtering glare of gas, but something wan and ethereal with green tones that somehow turned the blood rather waterish to look at.

I cocked my pistol and gave Arthur the nod. Why in the blazes did it have to be just us on this charge to glory? “Come on then, ours is not to reason why…”

A swift kick and the door splintered, revealing the interior of a rudely furnished little room. At one end a man of rough demeanour who I took to be the miller held a bloodied knife. His other hand was missing several fingers and a welter of gore lay in a clay bowl on a sort of altar before him, atop which sat the open book. The miller’s drool-stained lips and rolling eyes made it clear that he and sanity had parted company some ways back.

At the other end of the room, a young slip of a thing stood with her eyes rolled back in her head, sheets of faintly glowing greenish-white material running from her mouth and nose to the nearby walls and furniture. The ectoplasmic sheets bulged with faces, half-formed yet horribly familiar, and below it all the susurrus of voices could faintly be heard.

The miller looked over and giggled, gesturing with his stumped hand so that blood spattered down onto the table, “A man with seven fingers will grind with blood instead of water, as the Rhymer spake.”

“What… what even is going on here?” Arthur was clearly out of his depth, and I must confess I was having trouble deciding who to shoot myself when suddenly the many faces squirming in the ectoplasm faded away to be replaced by a single stern-looking older man.

“Arthur? Arthur my boy? It’s been so long, Arthur, I’ve missed you so much!” The voice came from a million miles away and somewhere right behind you at the same time.

“Daddy? Is that… is that you?” Arthur’s lip trembled.

“Arthur? Steady now, Arthur, you know the rules—we don’t engage in conversation with Things from Beyond.” I licked my lips nervously as I added Arthur to the list of people I might have to shoot this afternoon.

The face pressed forward again, certainly the very likeness of Henry Roxburgh from the portrait of Arthur’s parents hanging in Hunter House, “Come with us, Arthur. We’re here. We’re waiting for you, your mother and I.”

Suddenly a change came over young Roxburgh; his demeanour flickered from reverential hopefulness to disgust in an instant. Before I could even blink he’d raised his firearm and fired a shot through the ghostly apparition’s forehead. With a shrieking wail the glowing membrane dissolved into the aether from which it had come, and we were left in pitch darkness and biting cold.

Using numb fingers I fumbled a lucifer out of my pocket and struck a light, only to reveal both miller and girl unconscious, while Arthur sat calmly at the table, his pistol in front of him. 

Honestly, I was a bit dumbfounded “You… you all right there, Arthur m’boy?”

“Perfectly fine, Dr Cadwallader. Never better.”

Knowing perfectly well that he wasn’t, I nevertheless left him in his funk and organised for the rest of the Chapter to come and assist us in cleaning up this fearful mess. It wasn’t until much later that evening that I finally plucked up the courage to ask Lady Roxburgh what had caused such a response.

Her reply, typically curt, was not terribly illuminating, “Arthur’s mother, Caroline Roxburgh, is not dead—although she might well wish it were otherwise.”

Discretion being the better part of valour, I declined to probe any further. And after all, it was nearly time for supper by that point, and I was, in any case, famished.
