The horse was tired and I was hungry, and the fiery sunset had long since faded from the peaks and the rushing Thomson river by the time we arrived. It had been a hard ride down the St Vrain canyon, and I was ready for all the rest and comfort that the little hamlet of Estes Park could provide. I drew the horse to a halt outside the largest of its log cabins, dismounted and rapped smartly on the door. 

It was opened by a short, round man of early middle age, with a flush to his cheeks that spoke of a fondness for the gin bottle, but his smile was welcoming enough. 

“Is it Miss Bird?” he asked, in a pronounced Welsh accent.

“It is,” I said. “Miss Isabella Bird, of Edinburgh.”

“Griffith Evans, at your service. We’ve been expecting you some time. Hard journey through the mountains, was it?”

“Is there any other kind?”

“I dare say not, this time of year.” He smiled pleasantly, and reached out a hand for my reins. “Shall I show you to the stables?”

I accepted his offer, and once Birdie was settled and munching contentedly on a bale of hay, I followed my host to one of the smaller log cabins—a little room with a stone chimney, and a smaller bedroom to the rear equipped with a hay bed, a tin basin on a chair, a shelf and some pegs. Compared to the trappers' huts where I had spent my last few weeks, it seemed the very height of luxury.

“How much do I owe you, Mr Evans?” I asked.

“Two dollars a week,” he said, “Bed and board. The wife serves three meals a day in the big cabin, and there’s always bread and milk if you’re hungry in between. You’re paid up a month already—your aunt sent it ahead of you.”

“My aunt?” I thought for a moment, then realised with amusement who must have sent the eight dollars on my behalf. “My aunt. Of course.”

“You looking to settle, or just passing through, if you don’t mind me asking?”

“Here to visit,” I said. “To explore, and to climb as many of these hills as possible.”

The Welshman sucked his teeth. “You’ve come at the wrong time of year for that,” he said. “If you’d arrived a month ago, you could have pleased yourself on the whole range. As it is, snow’ll be in before long.”

“Then I shall have to begin without delay,” I said. “Can you recommend a local guide—a native, perhaps, Mr Evans?”	

“No Indians in these parts,” he said, somewhat abruptly, I thought. “But there’s a trapper setting off up Long's Peak next day or two. Knowing him, he might be persuaded to take you with him, snow or no snow.”

“Capital!” Tiring of conversation, I did my best to guide my host towards the door. The sweet smelling hay of the bed was more tempting than any supper he could offer, and I could feel the welcome pull of sleep. “Then perhaps you could introduce me tomorrow. Good night, Mr Evans.”

He tipped his hat courteously. “Good night, Miss Bird.”

I slept as only the truly exhausted can—profoundly, gratefully, and dreamlessly, and awoke refreshed to find the sun streaming through the window onto the bed. A breeze blew through the hut, and I judged that in a month’s time it would be unpleasantly cold, but for now I found it only contributed to the delights of my quaint little home. Once dressed I joined my host in the main cabin for breakfast, which was beef, potatoes, bread and coffee, accompanied by milk and cream in seemingly limitless quantity. Presiding over the meal was Evans’ wife, a round, jolly little Scotswoman from the Orkneys who greeted me as though I were a long lost kinswoman.

“So good to have you with us, Miss Bird! I do what I can, but this place is sorely wanting for more of a woman’s touch. Do you plan to stay, do you suppose?”

“For the winter, at least,” I said, helping her clear the table. “I’m eager to do some walking in these beautiful mountains of yours.”

“Oh, they’re bonny, right enough. But you’ll need a guide, and they won’t work so late in the year. Stay until spring, it’s even lovelier then.” She beamed me a brilliant smile.

“Mr Evans mentioned a man—a fur trapper—who was mounting an expedition?”

Her sunny demeanor darkened. “That’ll be Rocky Mountain Jim, Miss Bird—but between you and me that man’s no good. He’ll take your money and take you up the peak, but first sign of trouble he’ll leave you and save his own skin.” 

“I’m looking for a guide, not a nursemaid, Mrs Evans,” I said, feeling a hint of frustration at her over-solicitous manner.

“Up to you, of course, Miss Bird,” she said, somewhat sourly, I thought. “But the man’s a villain through and through, and don’t say I didn’t warn you when you come to grief.”

I sent a short letter and a reasonable sum of money to my prospective guide with one of Evans’ drovers that morning, and spent a pleasant morning exploring the valley. Below the house, on the stream which issued from the lake, I found a beautiful log dairy with a waterwheel lazily spinning. Next to this was a corral, a wagon shed, a labourer’s hut, and a cattle shed which also saw use as a stable—it was undeniably picturesque, but the homely delights of the hamlet paled next to the breathtaking splendour of the mountains beyond.

In all my travels, I have never seen their like. Seven ranges towered over me in great spires of rosy granite, carved with dark canyons and mysterious valleys. At the south end of the park, Long’s Peak rose to a height of nearly fifteen thousand feet, its bare, scathed head slashed with eternal snow. Even here, at half that altitude, frost had formed overnight on the sweet grass, and I knew within days the snows would cover the valley as well as the peaks. 

At noon, I returned to join Mrs Evans and the others for lunch—more beef, bread, potatoes and coffee—but to my surprise the cabin was in uproar; seemingly the whole village gathered in an anxious, shifting tangle around the table.

“What on earth is the matter?” I asked Mrs Evans, who turned a face white with alarm towards me.

“A bear,” she said. There was an uneasy look in her eyes


    “A bear? In the village?” I asked.

She shook her head. “No, Miss Bird. Up by Black Canyon.”

“What happened?”

“Billy and Davey had taken the kye up for grazing. Davey says he went off after a steer, and when he came back, Billy was dead.”

“Did he see a bear?” I asked. “The surviving man, I mean.”

“He said he heard a roar, and a scream, but by the time he got back the beast was gone.”

“And the body?”

Mrs Evans pointed to the cattle shed. “It’s an awful thing to happen -...” She seemed to check herself, and I wondered if she was going to continue her sentence. She did not. The little Scotswoman seemed profoundly uneasy—but then, I suppose even in these rough frontier villages sudden death by bear was enough to shake the hardiest of souls.

“My condolences,” I said, and waited until my hostess had returned inside. Such was the uproar in the hamlet that I could make my way undisturbed to the cattle shed, and even before I entered, I could smell the sharp, iron tang of freshly spilled blood.

The body was covered in a sheet, deposited without ceremony against the right-hand wall of the shed. His wounds must have been horrific, for already the white linen was blossoming with scarlet roses where it touched the corpse. I reached a tentative hand to draw back the cloth, curiosity and revulsion rising in me. 

The sheet seemed to grasp at the body, and it took a jerk of my hand to pull it free of the clotted blood beneath. I had seen the victims of bear attacks before, and was braced for the most appalling of injuries, but what I saw horrified even me.

The body had been skinned—there was no other word to describe it. There were no claw marks or even knife wounds to indicate how the deed might have been accomplished—it was as though the skin had simply sloughed off, leaving the red muscle and white sinew beneath. Worst of all were the lidless eyes, staring in eternal horror from the raw meat of the face.

I heard a noise behind me, and hastily replaced the sheet before turning, expecting Evans or one of the other labourers. Instead, it was a fresh nightmare that confronted me—a huge, shadowy figure obscuring the light. The outline might have been that of a man, but the face defied description. The side that was turned to me was an eyeless ruin of twisted scar tissue—the ear gone, the definition of the jaw obliterated where it met the neck, the mouth drawn back in a rictus that bared the teeth. 

I think I must have screamed at the sight, and it was only when the head turned and I saw the rest of the face that I realised what I had taken for a monster was only a mortal man after all—the left side of his face hideously disfigured, but the other commonplace enough. No, I thought a moment later—the face was anything but commonplace. Before his ghastly injuries, the man must have been strikingly handsome. Under an unkempt mop of tawny curls, a piercing blue eye regarded me appraisingly. The unspoilt side of his mouth was a smooth, sensual curve, and the line of his jaw, beneath a day’s stubble, was strong and resolute. From the one side, his profile was fit to grace a coin—from the other, it was as though a child had scribbled over a beautiful portrait hard enough to score through the paper.

“I... beg your pardon,” I said, knowing that I had stared for longer than courtesy would permit.

“You a friend of Billy Lamb?” he asked. I thought I detected a hint of an English accent below the stockman’s drawl. 

“A neighbour only,” I said, getting to my feet. “Miss Isabella Bird.”

The newcomer turned the bad side of his face towards me. “You find what you were looking for, Miss Bird?” he asked.

“I was curious to see the man’s injuries, that’s all.” I wiped my bloody fingers on my skirts. “I don’t believe I caught your name.”

“Don’t believe I gave it,” the man said.

“Might I ask for it, then?”

He looked at me with his one good eye. “Jim Nugent. Folks round here call me Rocky Mountain Jim.”

He was dressed in trappers’ furs, his feet covered with soft moccasins and his head with a frontiersman’s hat. I could see a revolver tucked into his breast pocket, and there was a Bowie knife on his left hip. He looked every inch his name.

“Well, that is capital news, Mr Nugent,” I said. “Did you receive my message?”

“Reckon I did.”

“And the money?”

He nodded.

“Marvellous. I take it, then, you’re willing to act as my guide in these parts?”

“So long as you’re paying,” he said. “You’re good for a week with what you’ve paid so far.”

It was outrageous, of course—the sum of money would have bought me a pair of guides for month at any reasonable rate—but as the only mountaineer for hire within forty miles, it appeared I was stuck with him. There was little chance I’d be able to claim it on expenses, either, as I doubted he was able to write, let alone be in the habit of handing out receipts. 

“Not afraid of bears, are you, Miss Bird?” He jerked his head towards the corpse.

“Only the ones who carry a skinning knife, Mr Nugent,” I said. When do we depart?”

He laughed, and the escape of breath from the ruined side of his mouth added a thin wheeze to the sound. “Tomorrow at dawn. Bring a bedroll, and furs.”

He tipped his hat to me, turned, and walked away. I sighed, and felt myself relax despite the fact that I was standing mere inches from a mutilated corpse. The corpse, I reasoned, could not hurt me. The same could not be said with any certainty of my new acquaintance. 

The weather was settled enough come morning that I thought we might embark on our climb with some hope of success. True to his word, Nugent was waiting outside the log cabin before light with a collie dog and a pair of ponies, both laden with panniers and blankets over the saddle. We might have been setting off for a week, rather than a climb I hoped would take two days at most. Nonetheless, I said nothing, only swinging myself up onto the smaller of two ponies and following meekly behind the trapper. 

Nugent said nothing as the little hamlet fell away behind us. We followed a trail across the plain towards the foot of the peak. After a half mile of smooth grasslands, we picked up a narrow trail that led us through winding canyons, glades, lakes and streams, the pale light of the rising sun painting it in every hue imaginable. A lake of amethyst water covered in lilies reflected the great grey pines as we passed, and I had an hour to marvel at its beauty as we followed the trail alongside it. At last, as the daylight was fading, we reached the treeline of an ancient pine forest that had never known the lumberjack’s axe, and turned the ponies to enter its twilit, silent gloom.

“Where shall we make camp?” I asked my guide, and for the first time on our journey he troubled to answer me.

“A ways yet.”

“Yes, but how far a ways?”

He reined in his pony and waiting until I drew alongside him. “Journey getting too long for you, Miss Bird?”

“Not at all, Mr Nugent.”

“Good. Get off your pony.”

I stared at him. “I beg your pardon?”

“Trail coming up’s too steep to ride. Get off your pony, or break your fool neck; up to you.”

He swung his long leg over the pommel of his saddle and dropped to the ground. Clicking to his pony, and with the dog falling in obediently at his heels, he led the way up a steepening track. I followed the dog’s example, and soon saw the wisdom of his instructions. The ponies were blowing hard as we climbed. I kept my eyes on my feet for the most part, and more than once was startled by the lash of a dead branch across my face or shoulder. Nugent passed ghost-like down the track, and I marvelled at the easy grace that seemed to make him part of the landscape.

As we climbed, I became increasingly aware of a sensation of being watched. At first I thought it was merely my imagination, kindled into life by the dry rustle of the pine needles underfoot and the breeze overhead—but even as the pines thinned and we found ourselves on a bare, rocky slope, the feeling only intensified. 

“Is anyone else likely to be climbing the mountain?” I asked, with some trepidation.

He shook his head without turning. “Not so late in the year.”

I hurried my pony to catch him. “I am quite sure we’re being watched,” I whispered.

He spat. “Nobody living here but us.”

That was when I saw the other traveller, just ahead of us on the next ridge. He was pressed close against a tree, and in the dim light I might have missed him had it not been for a single, indiscreet movement. “Mr Nugent!” I whispered, and Nugent walked on as though studiously ignoring me.

“Nothing to see,” he said, without moving his lips. “Keep on walking.”

“There is a man up ahead,” I said softly, doing my best to seem unconcerned.

“Trick of the light.”

When I looked again, the figure was gone. “It was there, I swear I saw it.”

He stopped, and looked me full in the face. “Light plays tricks with you, up here. Like as not you saw a shadow and made a man out of it.”

“I am not God, to conjure flesh out of the firmament,” I said, feeling my face flush. “I tell you I saw a man, standing with his back to that tree.” 

“Camp’s coming up,” he said indifferently, and though I tried hard to examine the base of the tree as we passed, I could make out nothing at all out of the ordinary.

The trail opened at last onto a wide plateau, just above the treeline, and we made our camp in a little grove of the beautiful silver spruce. The afterglow was fading, and a huge, heavy moon rose over us, casting the trees, the snowy hillside and the mirrored lake below in shades of silver and white. It was an exquisite, if ghostly, view.

I lit a fire and boiled water while Nugent erected a simple two sided tent and laid out our bedrolls side-to-side on a thick bed of pine shoots. The ponies were rewarded with a nose bag of oats each, and we made a hearty supper of dried meat, bread and tea drunk from an empty meat tin. The dog was given a portion of rations from his master’s hand, settling himself at our feet with a sigh. 

“Mr Evans said there were no natives in the area,” I said, as we drank our tea.

Nugent shook his head. “Cleared out, couple years back.”

“To make room for the settlers?”

“Same reason as always. For the land. Killed plenty of them myself in the Indian wars. Nothing I’m proud of now.”  He leaned forward to scratch the dog’s head. “Used to get ‘em coming through looking for work, but not any more. Bad business a couple years ago—young fellow and his squaw came to Estes Valley with a couple kids, trying to make a home. All of ‘em killed, one after the other.”

“Was the murderer ever found?”

Nugent shrugged. “Don’t believe no one ever looked that hard.”

By nine o’ clock, the mercury was reading twelve below freezing, and it was with no great reluctance that I took my place in our makeshift tent, the dog on one side and Nugent on the other, and drifted into a pleasant, exhausted slumber. 

I must confess I did not expect to wake with a knife at my throat. However, I had learned of old to be prepared for any eventuality, and my derringer was still under my pillow when I reached for it. I kept my hand there, out of sight, and feigned a gradual return to consciousness, opening my eyes wide in innocent surprise.

“Mr Nugent!” I cried. “What is the meaning of this?”

“Enough of your game,” he said, pushing the knife’s edge against my throat. “Why are you here?”

I brought my hand to rest on his, as though I intended to push him away. The other I brought from under the pillow, the loaded derringer in it pressed against his flank.

“I might ask you the same,” I said conversationally. His good eye narrowed. “I’ve no doubt you could cut my throat, but not before I put a bullet into your gut. Not a pleasant way to die—given my choice, I’d take the knife. Or you put the knife away and we discuss this in a civilised manner.”

After a moment—in which I could see that he was tempted to take his chances with the bullet—he sat back on his heels. I sat up and wrapped the bedroll around me. I was already cold without the benefit of his body heat.

“You begin, then, Mr Nugent,” I said, conversationally. “A question for a question seems fair.”

“What’re you here for?” he asked.

I chose my words carefully. “I’m investigating, on behalf of my employer and her organisation. Last winter there was a spate of attacks reported in Estes Park—eight white settlers were killed, and a ninth was mutilated, but survived. When the thaw came, the attacks ceased. The newspapers reported bear attacks, but it would be a curious bear that skinned a man and left the carcass uneaten. I’m looking for the creature that did it. My question now.”

He gave me a curt nod. 

“Why are you here?

“Same reason you are. Looking for that thing skinned those folks. Ain’t no bear. Who you working for?” he added abruptly.

“I’m not at liberty to answer that, I’m afraid.”

His face darkened like a sudden summer storm. “You working for that dog Dunraven?”

I shook my head. “No. My employer is an Englishwoman, and I have no connection to the gentleman you mentioned.” I neglected to add that Henry Kingsley, Lord Dunraven, had been in correspondence with my employer, and had indeed been the one to draw the murders to her attention—but a lady must have some secrets, after all. He seemed to relax a little. “My turn for a question, I think. The natives who tried to settle in Estes Park. What were the manner of their deaths?”

The night air was mercilessly cold, and I moved to the side to offer him space in the bedroll, which he accepted after a brief hesitation. “Same as the others. Found skinned, every one of them, oldest to youngest.”

“Those were the first then. Interesting. I don’t believe that was widely publicised.”

“This country’s made it its business to wipe out the natives since Columbus took his first step onto dry land,” Nugent said, spitting the words as though they had a bitter taste. “Dead Indians don’t make the news.”

“You were the ninth man, weren’t you, Mr Nugent?” The firelight played over the scarred surface of his face, giving it the look of a fiery lava flow. For a long time he was silent, gazing into the leaping flames, until at last he turned back to me.

“Six settlers dead,” he said. “And the five natives from the year before. Larssen, Reilly and me, we decided enough was enough. Tracked it up the peak, made camp ready for the climb. First night it took Reilly while we were sleeping, right from under our noses. Nothing left but a smear where it’d pitched him into the ravine. He must have hurt it, though. It left a trail of blood up to the peaks, and we chased the damn thing down. When we found it, it was wearing Reilly’s skin. I put a bullet in the damn thing, but it just kept coming—got its fingers hooked behind my ear and pulled, and I swear to God half my face just peeled off me like skimming fat off bacon. Larssen dragged it away before it could finish the job—I reckon the last thing I saw out of two eyes was the pair of them falling off the peak. I never saw Larssen again. I figured the beast was gone with him.”

“Until the attacks began again?”

He nodded. “Folks down there can say it’s a bear all they like, but even they don’t believe it.”

“I don’t believe it either, Mr Nugent. But I give you my word, I intend to deal with it, whatever it is.” He grunted, and I decided to take the sound for assent. “Excellent. Well, then, are you still resolved to slit my throat in the night, or shall we continue our work together?”

He let out a short laugh at that. “Reckon you’ve got yourself a reprieve for now, Miss Bird. Or maybe I have.”

I cannot say I slept well for the remainder of the night—a lingering mistrust of my companion and a vivid awareness of the fact that a man had been silently skinned here beside his slumbering companions made rest an impossibility. I watched the sun rise and turn the grey plains to purple, suffusing the sky and the peaks with red. On another day I might have thought it beautiful. Today, it put me uncomfortably in mind of a blood-soaked corpse.

The trail had flattened out, and we mounted our ponies again and set off up the hill, the collie dog ranging ahead of us in wide, easy circles. I wondered if he had picked up a trail, as he would sniff furiously at the ground, then return, barking, to his master, but Nugent merely acknowledged him with a nod of his head and sent the dog off again.

At the boulder field, which Nugent referred to as the “Lava Flows”, we left the ponies. Hardy mountain creatures, they could take care of themselves until our return, and I had not seen so much as the tail of a wolf, bear or bobcat. It seemed that they had been driven away by the greater predator of this mountain—one that had no interest in horse meat.

“What manner of creature do you suppose it is?” I asked Nugent, as we picked our way over the treacherous ground.

He shrugged. “No idea. Don’t need to know its name to kill it.”

“Yes, but how?”

“Guess I’ll cross that bridge when it comes.”

He showed remarkable confidence for a man who’d faced it before and lost, I thought, but I decided to keep that observation to myself. 

“I wondered if it might be some spirit native to these hills,” I suggested. “Lured down by the growing settlement to slake its bloodlust.”

“You’da thought the natives would know it for cursed ground then, if that were the case.” Nugent reached out a hand to help me up one of the larger boulders, and I took it gratefully. “And they worked this land just fine before the white folks came.”

Up ahead, Ring began to bark furiously, and Nugent hurried ahead to catch him. When I slipped and scrambled my way over to join them, the dog was sniffing at a dark patch on a rock, which, on closer inspection, was unmistakably a bare human footprint. 

“Blood,” Nugent said. “Can’t be far now.”

By the time we left the boulder field there was hard packed ice between the rocks, and the sky was heavy with the promise of snow. We passed through a rocky gate that Nugent called the Notch, and passed onto the narrow ridge that separated the whaleback of the mountain from the final climb to the summit. The ridge itself was only a few feet wide. It shelved away to a great green lake on one side, and a corrie of broken red rock on the other. Either way the fall would be fatal. I have never had much of a head for heights, and I found the experience gruelling enough even without the supernatural horrors that might lie ahead. Nugent pointed to the great stone slab of the true summit ahead. 

“Up there,” he said. 

“The very top?” I asked, and he nodded. 

“The top, or near as makes no difference.”

The air was thin, dry and painfully cold. By the time we reached the base of the last stony pinnacle, I could taste blood in my throat. I sipped judiciously at my water, and noticed that Nugent had barely touched his water bottle. The reason for this became clear when we stopped for a brief rest. He took a single sip, then poured the rest into a shallow bowl for the dog, who lapped at it gratefully. The respite, however, was all too brief, and soon we were on our way again.

Soft flakes of snow began to fall, and all the world around us was white. Nugent checked the bearing on his compass, and tucked it away with a frown. Ring, initially delighted by the flakes, soon ceased his gambolling and began to whine.

“We’re going to need shelter,” I said. 

Nugent’s frown deepened. “All right,” he said at last. “This way.”

The climb would have been bad in summer conditions. In the snow, it was a nightmare. Nugent and I took the decision to rope together, in the hopes that if one of us fell the other might halt their descent. In reality, it represented the simple acknowledgement that if one of us fell, the other would likely die trying to get off the mountain alone. Our chances were better together, or so I told myself.

There was some respite from the biting cold as we came around the pinnacle not far from its base. At first I could only discern the faintest of dark shadows on the rock, but as we got closer, I saw the narrow mouth of a cave, projecting back into the rock. Nugent drew his Colt and I my derringer, and we crept into the dimly lit chamber.

I froze. There were people in the room—standing naked and swaying side-to-side and front-to-back as we entered. I gasped and jerked my pistol to bear, but Nugent was faster, slapping my hand down before I could give fire. He fumbled in his pack, and produced a roughly constructed wooden torch, which he lit. As light filled the cavern, I realised that what I had taken for living bodies were empty skins, hanging like suits of clothes, suspended by their hair from iron hooks driven into the roof of the cavern.

“Skins,” Nugent whispered. My stomach twisted with revulsion as he took hold of the nearest skin and rubbed it between thumb and forefinger. “It’s soft,” he said. 

“Fresh, do you suppose?” I asked, fighting my rising stomach. “Or cured.”

“Can’t be fresh. No blood.”

“There must be a dozen of them.” Those nearest the door were pale, with scalps of brown or russet or gold. Behind them, four darker skins hung in order of size, the largest with a luxuriant plume of black hair. I tried not to think about the smaller two. “No—thirteen.” Out of the corner of my eye, I saw what I first took for the skin of another child. It was smaller than the rest, with tawny brown curls, and could not have been more than three feet in length, but instead of empty feet, this skin ended in tatters like the torn skirt of a jacket. 

“Goddamn it,” I heard Nugent say. I realised he had recognised it as the remains of his own stolen skin.

I heard footsteps on the ground a second before the creature struck. It hit my back with tremendous force, propelling me face-first to the ground where I sprawled, winded. My derringer clattered from my hand, and the rank smell of freshly skinned meat filled my nostrils as I struggled in vain against its monstrous strength. Two clawed hands locked into my hair and begin to tug at my scalp—and with overwhelming horror I felt my skin begin to tear free.

There was a deafening explosion, and the agonising pressure on my head eased just enough for me to draw breath. I turned my head the inch the creature would allow, and saw Nugent advancing towards it, pistol in one hand and a burning brand in the other. Like a lion tamer, he brandished it first towards it, close enough that I could feel the heat singing my hair, then to the hanging rows of human skin. He touched the fire to the nearest, and it immediately began to singe and sizzle, filling the cave with the smell of crackling.

The creature screamed, and dropped me. My head hit the floor hard enough to send stars dancing in front of my eyes, and before I could force them back into focus Nugent was hauling me upright and dragging me from the cave. I had time for one look over my shoulder at my attacker, and saw a figure from hell. It stood as high as a man, though grotesquely twisted and elongated in its form—haloed in flame and shrieking out its rage as it gathered its smouldering prizes into its arms and strove to put out the fires consuming them. 

How Nugent and I survived that headlong dash down the peak and across the ridge I have no idea. The blizzard was well underway, and I remember our flight only in isolated fragments—the dizzying whirl of snowflakes that seemed to converge from all sides, losing my footing over and over again as we half scrambled, half slid away. More than once I trusted my weight to what I thought was solid ground, only for my boot to sink through the crust of snow and risk me tumbling to my death. I think had it not been for the rope, we should both have died a dozen times over.

As we neared the plateau, we heard Ring barking furiously, and a few minutes later a streak of black and white launched itself towards Nugent out of the dark. Only when Nugent whistled and the shape flattened in a crouch did I realise it was Ring. 

We found the ponies not far from where we had made camp, dead and already half covered with snow, though there was still heat rising from the bodies. They had been eviscerated, guts spilling out onto the ground, but the wounds were sharp and clean, not the ragged tears caused by a wolf’s fangs. Nugent moved like an automaton, stripping what we could take from the ponies’ saddlebags, while the dog hovered anxiously around his feet. 

“We need to get off this damn hill,” he said, at last.

I nodded wearily. My scalp and forehead were aching and bruised where the creature had seized me, me feet were solid lumps of ice and the skin of my hands shredded by my tumble down the icy rocks—but still I couldn’t find it in me to disagree.

“I know what it is,” I said, as we stumbled down the track that had been so hard in daylight, and now, in the snow and the dark, seemed almost impossible. “I’ve read about it. I should have thought of it—but I was so convinced it belonged to these hills —” Fatigue was clouding my thoughts, and I shook my head to clear it. “A nuckelavee. It’s a… a demonic spirit, I suppose. Conjured up to do the caster’s bidding, but like all of these things, the genie gets out of the bottle. It looks like a skinned man, except when it’s wearing the skins of its victims.”

“How do you kill it?” Nugent asked.

“I don’t know.” I racked my brain, desperately trying to remember any more than the bare minimum from the texts I had read. “Fresh water—they don’t care for that.”

Nugent looked up at the tumbling snowflakes, and laughed. “It don’t seem to mind it much frozen.”

“It makes sense.” I took another step forward, each more difficult than the last. “It waits in the mountains till the snows come before it heads down to the valley. The thaws chase it back up to its lair.”

“Damn fool,” Nugent said. I couldn’t tell if he was referring to me, the beast, or himself.

I don’t know how long we walked through the whiteout; I don’t think I was fully conscious for most of it. I barely noticed the low, squat shape of a trapper’s hut as we approached it, registering only vaguely the indignity as Nugent stripped me out of my outer clothes on the threshold then bundled me inside. The cabin stank of mould and decay, and its only comforts were a heap of filthy blankets in the corner—but there was a stove, and a woodpile, and before long Nugent had a merry enough blaze going.

“Good night,” I said, and made to lay myself down.

“No,” Nugent said, grabbing my frozen hands and sitting me upright before the flames. “Get warm first. I’ve seen too many folks lie down cold and not get up again.”

At that moment, the prospect of slipping into a gentle oblivion felt thoroughly welcome, but Nugent was resolute. He boiled snow for tea and forced the hot tin into my hands, then busied himself forming a sort of nest of blankets with us in the middle. He removed my socks and mittens, hung them in front of the stove to dry, then rubbed at my hands and feet with merciless kindness. The pain, as feeling returned, was exquisite, and I struggled not to cry. I realised only later than he must have been every bit as cold, sore and fatigued as I was.

“Better?” he asked at last.

“Better,” I said.

“You can sleep a couple of hours,” he said. “We’ll set off again when it’s light.”

I lay down and curled myself on my side, and was mildly surprised when he settled himself beside me. The dog sighed loudly and took up a watchful position between the embers of the stove and the door. The snow fell outside in a soft, muting blanket, and the hut seemed almost homely.

As I lay, balancing between sleep and wakefulness, I became acutely aware of the warmth of the human body against me. Nugent’s back was to me, his good side against the floor, scars turned upward to the roof. I pressed myself into his back, feeling his skin burning hot through the linen of his shirt, and casually, as if making an involuntary movement in my sleep, let my hand rest on the smooth expanse of his flank. I felt his muscles stiffen at my touch and knew he must be awake. He made no move to pull away as I lifted his shirt and slid my hand underneath. His body, I discovered, was just as mutilated as his face, the roped bands of twisted scar tissue tapering at last to healthy skin just above the level of his hip. He rolled to face me as my hand trailed lower, with an expression unreadable in the firelight. 

“May I?” I asked. He nodded.

I leaned towards him and pressed my lips to his. The good side of his mouth was soft and yielding; the scars on the other rasping gently over my chapped lips. I found myself wondering how the touch of those scars would feel on other, more delicate parts. Nugent did not disappoint.

I think there was not an inch of each other we did not explore that night with fingers, tongues and lips. Nugent proved a gentle and adept lover, and for my part I took delight not only in his caresses, but in the sounds and shudders of pleasure that I excited from him. The heat of our lovemaking warmed the little shack, and at last, the pair of us exhausted, I drifted to sleep wrapped in his arms.

The snowfall stopped a little before dawn, and we rose with the grey light streaking through the gaps in the hut’s walls. The fire had burned out in the night, and the air was cold as we struggled back into our still damp furs. Nugent was delightfully shy, looking away as I dressed, as though my body had any secrets to keep from him.

“That sure was something last night,” he said at last, mumbling into his tin of tea.

“The monster, the snow or the intimacy?” I asked. “All would qualify. Nonetheless, the third is the only one I intend to repeat.”

A smile sparked across his face. “Reckon we’ve got a walk and a monster to kill first, Miss Bird.”

“First thing, we warn the settlers,” I said, as we stepped into the brilliance of the snow-covered day. The sky overhead was a brilliant clear blue, hardly recognisable as the same firmament that had held the lowering grey cloud of last night. “It fears fire, we’ve seen that. Even if bullets can’t hurt it, they can at least drive it away.”

“They going to keep a fire burning all winter?” Nugent countered.

“They may have to. It may be the only way for them to stay safe until we can learn how to deal with it for good.”

“The pass’ll be frozen in a couple of days. You won’t get a letter out until spring.”

The thought of three long months of darkness, a skinless horror lurking just out of the torchlight, was enough to send a shiver down my already chilly spine. “Then we shall have to do what we can,” I said, straightening up and walking on with as much purpose as I could muster.

Even in these marginally better conditions our progress was still achingly slow. Only Ring seemed to be finding the journey easy, leaping joyously from one snowy tussock to another. If the creature was ahead of us, it had left no trail in the snow, though that was small comfort knowing how unnatural a beast it was. By the time we got our first sight of the hamlet, the sky was deepening to a radiant violet, and I was struck despite myself by the remarkable beauty of the Rockies, as stunning in their winter mantle as in their summer glory.

“Not far now,” I said by way of encouragement. Nugent was quietly preoccupied, and more than once I spotted him checking his pistol and the edge of his hunting knife. 

“Reckon not,” he said.

Down in the valley the creek had frozen over, the millwheel turning idly, the vast blocks of ice moving under its paddles. The hamlet was dark, and I judged by the stars the time must be close to midnight.

“What now?” I asked Nugent.

“Guess we go wake ‘em up and tell them there’s trouble.”

I stopped. 

“Miss Bird?”

“Look.” I pointed at the snow in front of us. There, unmistakably, was a bloody, naked human footprint—then, ahead of it, another, heading straight towards the Evans’ hut. As we approached, the trail stopped in the cleared snow around the house.

“You go wake ‘em,” Nugent suggested. “I’ll go in the back way.” 

I drew my derringer. “Be careful, Mr Nugent.”

“You too, Miss Bird.”

The cabin’s door swung open at my touch, and the moment I stepped over the threshold I knew something was terribly wrong. The cabin was dark, and the air was full of the raw, wet smell of skinned meat. As I stumbled forward, my foot contacted a soft bundle on the floor and I stifled a yelp. Bending down, my hands groped their way across a human form—warm and breathing, though unconscious—and recognised it as Mr Evans. As I stood, I saw my hand was slick with blood where I had touched his head, though whether it was his own or the nuckelavee there was no way of knowing. 

The door to the cabin’s back room was closed, but I could see light shining around it. I crept forward, listening to the muffled sounds of distress coming from inside. I drew my derringer, and threw the door wide. 

Inside, Mrs Evans was bound hand and foot, kneeling on the floor with her face turned up to her assailant, whose hands were cradling the line of her jaw. 

“You weren't supposed to kill the whites,“ she was saying, voice thick with desperation. “I summoned you—I command you!”

I could only see half of his face, but the lamplight played over tawny auburn curls and a profile that I had come to know well over the last few days. 

“Nugent?” I whispered. 

He turned, and I realised my mistake. Half of its face—the wrong half—wore Nugent’s skin, but where his remaining eye was a clear bright blue, the creature glared at me with orange-yellow orbs, the pupil slit sideways like a goat’s. The other side of the face was stretched and elongated, the lipless mouth stretched wide in a carnivorous grin that reached to its ear. One hand was human, the other raw, red and taloned. The nightmarish mouth opened wider than should have been possible, and it shrieked a wordless howl of rage. 

I fired my pistol. Its hands jerked upwards, and Mrs Evans’ skin sloughed off her like a tomato under boiling water. She was still screaming when she hit the ground, though the sound had taken on a shrill, animal quality. Before the creature could spring, I lunged for the lantern—it was quicker than I was, and we both touched a hand to it at the same time. The lantern swayed, toppled, and crashed to the floor, spilling lamp oil across the woven rushes covering the cabin’s floor. It caught light immediately, tongues of flame licking up the cabin’s walls and across the floor. Mrs Evans screamed, and I saw that she, too, was aflame. 

I must confess I only entertained the thought of saving her for a moment. Her wounds were fatal, and to attempt to drag her to safety would have damned us both. Instead, I hardened my heart to her piteous wails, and sprinted with all the speed I had out of the room, slamming the door behind me. That only bought me a second, but it was enough. Nugent, having scouted outside, was standing in the doorway, gazing through the smoke at the glow of the inferno coming from the cabin’s back room.

“Help me with Evans!” I shouted, gesturing to the unconscious man on the floor. We took an arm each, and had just dragged him outside and deposited him in the snow when the door burst open, and a figure fit for hell surged after us. 

The nuckelavee was aflame, gobbets of blood and flesh sizzling as they fell and were extinguished in the snow. The stolen half of Nugent’s skin was charred and blackened, but those amber goat-eyes still stared from under the crackling skin with murderous intensity. I could hear shouts from the other villagers as they noticed the blaze; heard the cry for water go up. 

“Water!” I shouted. “Bring water!”

The heat of the flames was melting the snow around the nuckelavee’s feet. It seemed to recoil from the water, dancing onto solid ground or harder packed ice. Nugent seized a bucket from the nearest settler, half soaking himself in the process and cast it at the monster. It shrieked as though the water were acid and lunged forward, so that its grasping, clawed hands thrashed the air beside my face.

“Drive it this way!” I shouted, and out of the corner of my eye I saw Nugent grab another bucket from a bystander and hurl it towards me in a glittering spray. “And ready with your rope!” This time the droplets seemed only to goad the creature, and I skidded and slipped my way over the frozen snow, managing to stay mere inches ahead of its talons.

I felt the texture of the ground change subtly under my feet. Under the powdery white snow, the ice was hard, and I hoped desperately that it was thick enough. The nuckelavee was almost on me. I could feel the heat rising from its skin, and smell the rank carrion on its breath.

“Nugent! Throw me the rope—now!”

The beast sprang. Nugent hurled the rope out across the ice. I fired my derringer at the ice in front of me—and leapt for the rope.

The creature was half in the air as the ice shattered beneath it. It spun, cat-like in the air, landing on one clawed foot just at the edge of the hole in the ice. For a moment, I thought it would keep its balance, then it and I fell together through the collapsing ice into the freezing water beneath.

Beneath the surface, the darkness and the chill were absolute. My chest seized with absolute panic, and had it not been for the rope tugging me to the moonlit surface, I think I might have allowed the current to drag me down. Instead, I forced my freezing legs into motion, kicking spasmodically towards the light until at last I breached the surface and drew air into my lungs with a convulsive heave. Nugent was holding the other end of the rope, dragging me up hand over hand, and I slithered onto the frozen surface, feeling it crack and shift beneath me as I did so. I dared not look over my shoulder until I was safely on the bank with Nugent’s arm around me, shivering with the cold and the realisation of my narrow escape.

Downstream, I saw first a bare, bloody arm break the surface, then a moment later the hideous, elongated, skinned head. It seemed weakened by the water, and its movements were strangely purposeless as the river’s passage bore it downstream towards the idly spinning blades of the millwheel. We saw it for the last time, just before the paddle struck it and bore it under. In the light from the moon and the flames behind us, the flowing water turned to red, topped with a frothy pink foam. 

“Well, Mr Nugent,” I said through chattering teeth, gratefully accepting the blanket he draped around my shoulders, “Do you suppose we are finished with monsters and mountains for the winter?”

It took considerable effort to put out the blaze in the Evans’ cabin, but in the end the fire was contained from spreading to the adjacent buildings. Evans himself recovered, though when we visited him he had few words to say to us, and none of them were thanks. He seemed to hold Nugent singularly responsible for his wife’s death, although it was quite clear that the only one to blame for that was her own self. 

We pieced together the remains of the story without too much difficulty. Mrs Evans, it seemed, had resented the arrival of the native couple and their children, and had done all she could to encourage the community to reject them. When not even her husband could be persuaded to act against them, she drew on knowledge she had learned at her grandmother’s knee in the Orkneys, and summoned up the creature with the promise of fourfold sacrifice. 

At first, all had gone to plan—the interlopers had met a ghastly fate, and it seemed for a while that Mrs Evans’ sorcery had achieved its aim. But the nuckelavee, not content with only four victims, continued the hunt, until the thaw had forced it into the mountaintop until winter came round again. Doubtless she thought she retained some control over the beast until the last, but it is my belief that the creature slipped its arcane bridle almost the moment she called it forth, and acted only to slake its own, dreadful desires. Regardless, it is gone and the instigator of the wretched affair is dead, and in place of justice that will have to suffice.

I have written this account while events are fresh in my mind, and will send a properly sealed copy with any traveller willing to make the journey to Denver in the coming months. If none is to be found, I will carry it myself once the thaw sets in, but regardless these words will reach you before I do. I eagerly anticipate further instructions, and come the spring will make whatever journeys are required in service to the Society. For now, I must remain in Estes Park, beneath the lowering snow-topped mountains of Colorado, and while away the winter in a fur-trapper’s company.

I have the honour to remain, ma’am, your most obedient servant,
