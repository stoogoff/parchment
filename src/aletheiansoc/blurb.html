<h1>The Casebook of <span>The Aletheian Society</span></h1>

<p>Her Majesty Queen Victoria sits on the throne of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, but beneath the genteel veneer of society, dark forces are at work. Only the Aletheian Society, a secret organisation of scholars, occultists and adventurers, stands between the world and cataclysmic destruction.</p>

<p>Cursed artefacts, mysterious organisations, royal assignations, daemonic possessions, perilous journeys, infernal pacts and family secrets—the Aletheian Society faces them all in these eight chilling tales from some of today’s finest horror writers.</p>
